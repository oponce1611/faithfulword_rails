372	Marxist Lucifer King-Documentary	Pastor Anderson	2015-01-15 02:00:00	20150114P_MarxistLuciferKing-Documentary.mp3	-WACV9KZA64		f	Faithful Word Baptist Church	MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: My four little children, will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the judge of their character. I have a dream today. (Clapping) \r\n\r\nDom: Martin Luther King Junior is a man that is universally praised as one of the greatest heroes of the 20th century. Every year on the 3rd Monday in January, a national holiday is celebrated in his honor. But the truth is, that Martin Luther King Jr. was a wicked false prophet, a sexual pervert, and a Communist tool. This film is not about race; God has made all the nations of the earth of one blood. This film would judge Martin Luther King not by the color of his skin, but by the content of his character. \r\n\r\nPSA: Martin Luther King Jr. was a false prophet because he did not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Martin Luther King Jr. was a false prophet because he masqueraded as a Baptist pastor, yet he denied the virgin birth of Christ. Let me just read for you from his own writings: \r\n\r\n“First we must admit that the evidence for the tenability of this doctrine is too shallow to convince any objective thinker. To begin with, the earliest written documents in the New Testament make no mention of the virgin birth ...The effort to justify this doctrine on the grounds that it was predicted by the prophet Isaiah is immediately eliminated for all New Testament scholars agree that the word virgin is not found in the Hebrew original, but only in the Greek text which is a mistranslation of the Hebrew word for “young woman”.” –MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. (November 23, 1949) \r\n\r\nPSA: He’s saying that Isaiah 7:14 does not say that a virgin shall conceive, it just says that a young woman shall conceive and that Matthew got it wrong when he said a virgin shall conceive in the Greek New Testament. “All scholars agree that it doesn’t say Hebrew in the….” Oh really, if all scholars agree that the Hebrew original does not say “virgin” then why are there literally several hundred different English translations of the Bible on the market today that all say “virgin” in Isaiah 7:14? (Congregation: “Right!”) The King James says “virgin” and even all of these modern phony versions say “virgin” in Isaiah 7:14. Virtually every English bible that has ever been printed says “Virgin” in Isaiah 7:14, yet Martin Luther King. Jr says that all scholars agree that it shouldn’t say virgin there. Now if you don’t believe in the virgin birth: that leads you to not believe that Jesus is the son of God (Congregation: “Right”!) therefore Martin Luther King Jr. states later on that he doesn’t believe that Jesus is the son of God. Listen to this quote from the paper… \r\n\r\n“The church called Jesus divine because they had found God in him. They could only identify him with the highest and best in the universe. It was this great experience with the historical Jesus that led the early Christians to see him as the divine son of God.” - MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. PSA: So in that quote, he’s denying that Jesus is the son of God, and he’s denying that Jesus is divine, meaning he’s denying that Jesus is God (Congregation: “right”) now look down in your bible at 1 John 5:\r\n\r\n“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God?” – 1 John 5. \r\n\r\nMARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: We shall overcome. Deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome. \r\n\r\nPSA: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. did not overcome according to scripture, because the bible says right here for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith which is something that MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. did not have. (Congregation: “right”) and then look at the next verse. Who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God, no, WE as Bible-believing Christians shall overcome (Amen) but MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. did not overcome, because he did not believe that Jesus was the son of God. Listen to what he said about the resurrection…\r\n\r\n“At the age of 13, I shocked my Sunday School class by denying the bodily resurrection of Jesus. From the age of 13 on doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly.” –MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 1950 \r\n\r\n“The early Christians had lived with Jesus. They had been captivated by the magnetic power of his personality. This basic experience led to the faith that he could never die. And so in the pre-scientific thought pattern of the first century, this inner faith took outward form.” –MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 11/23/49 PSA: So he’s explaining that in their unscientific minds they came up with the resurrection of Jesus Christ because he believed in science falsely so-called (Congregation: “Right!”) Now what does the bible say about the bodily resurrection? You don’t have to turn there but in John chapter 2 verse 19… \r\n\r\n“Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. But he spake of the temple of his body.” -John 2:19, John 2:21 KJV PSA: He said destroy THIS temple and in three days I will raise it up. He was talking about his body therefore the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a bodily resurrection. (Congregation: “AMEN”). Of course we could go to many other scriptures that would show the same thing. He also taught that Christianity was just one of the many religions that came about at that time. And that it was heavily influenced by all the pagan religions around it. \r\n\r\n“That Christianity did copy and borrow from Mithraism cannot be denied, but it was generally a natural and unconscious process rather than a deliberate plan of action. It was subject to the same influences from the environment as were the other cults.” –MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 11/23/49 \r\n\r\nPSA: Now if you read that quote carefully you’ll realize that he is calling Christianity a cult and saying that it borrowed from the other cults. So this man is a Baptist pastor…he was a pastor of two different Baptist churches. Then he was an assistant pastor at a Baptist church. Look, is this man a Baptist? (Congregation: “NO!”). MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.’s organization that he operated out of was called the “Southern Christian Leadership Conference”. Is that a fitting name for it? I mean does this guy sound Christian? (Congregation: “No.”) But think about what a wicked person pretends to be a Baptist pastor while openly denying that Jesus is the son of God. Openly denying the virgin birth. Openly denying the resurrection. Openly denying all these things. You say well then why be a pastor? He was only a pastor to further his political and activist ambitions. (Congregation: “Amen”) it had nothing to do with religion. It had nothing to do with being spiritual. It just had to do with giving him a platform and a soap box to speak his message. Now, the Bible says: \r\n\r\n“Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! For so did their fathers to the false prophets (Luke 6:26 KJV). PSA: The Bible’s really clear: The false prophets are praised and spoken well of by the unbelieving world. (Congregation: “that’s right!”). And the true prophets are reviled and hated of this world. \r\n\r\nDom: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., while masquerading as a Baptist preacher, denied every major doctrine of the bible. He only used his position as pastor to advance his political career, and activism. The bible refers to unbelieving preachers who deny the doctrines of Christ as false prophets. According to God’s word, these men not only preach lies, but they are also wicked in every other area of life. They are described in the New Testament as adulterers, sexual perverts, and ministers of Satan. These descriptions ring true in the life of Dr. King. \r\n\r\nPSA: But someone’s response to this could be “Well okay so he didn’t believe the right doctrines from the bible, so what? He was still a great civil rights leader. He was still a great man and a great speaker. He still fought for a lot of great causes” That’s what a lot of people would say. “Who cares about his doctrine? We aren’t looking to him as a pastor, we aren’t looking to him as a spiritual leader! We’re just looking to him as a champion of political issues, and so what he believed about Jesus is not the issue.” Now here’s the thing, if he were just an unsaved guy who was a great political figure, I could see where someone was coming from with that. This is a man who is a Baptist pastor. (Congregation: “Right!”) That takes him from just being an unsaved dude to being a false prophet (Congregation: “yeah!”) What the bible says about false prophets all came true in the life of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. And the bible teaches very clearly that false prophets are rotten people to the core, not just that they happen to have a few doctrines wrong like the virgin birth and the fact that Jesus is the son of God, but rather that false prophets are actually wicked people through and through, that’s what the bible teaches. The bible famously says: \r\n\r\n“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” Matthew 7:15 KJV PSA: That’s how the bible describes false prophets: a wolf in sheep’s clothing. One who inwardly is a ravening wolf. Look what the bible says about false prophets in 2 Peter 2: \r\n\r\n“But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.” 2 Peter 2:1 KJV \r\n\r\n“Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;”2 Peter 2:14-15 KJV \r\n\r\nPSA: The bible says that not only are they denying Christ, and preaching damnable heresies, but that they have eyes full of adultery, that they cannot cease from sin, that they beguile unstable souls, that they have covetous practices. Go to Jude. Now the book of Jude is a parallel passage with 2 Peter 2: \r\n\r\n“Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of Dignities. Woe onto them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core…these are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear, clouds they are without water, carried about of winds, trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots…raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.” –Excerpt ofThe book of Jude, KJV PSA: But other than that he’s a great guy (Congregation: “hahaha”) I mean isn’t that what people think? But this is about false prophets (that’s right) how can you say that other than that he’s a great guy? Well just to remove all doubt go to Jeremiah chapter 23 to see what the bible says about false prophets back in the book of Jeremiah:\r\n\r\n“I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. Jeremiah 23:25 KJV \r\n\r\n“I have a dream today!” –MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. (Clapping going on). \r\n\r\n“How long shall this being the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? Yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart … behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord.” –Excerpt, Jeremiah 23 KJV \r\n\r\nPSA: So is He saying “Oh, so is society going to profit from this guy, even though he is a false prophet, he’s teaching lies, there are other good things we can get from him?” No! It says that he shall not profit these people at all. That’s what the bible says my friend. Now what did the bible specifically say about false prophets that they would do sinfully speaking? Well, he said in Jude that they would defile the flesh. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha being given over to fornication and so forth. He also said in 2 Peter 2 that they had eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was a serial adulterer and a major pervert which confirms what the bible predicted he would be. \r\n\r\nNewscaster Chris Hayes: “50 years ago this week, in November 1964, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover told a group of reporters on the record that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was quote “The most notorious liar in the country and a danger to the American way of life. And their attempts to discredit King went far beyond just calling him a liar. The FBI placed bugs in King’s hotel room, tapped his phones, bugged his apartment in Atlanta …” \r\n\r\nPSA: The FBI has fourteen filing cabinets full of eavesdropping data on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 64 thousand pages of this data was released to the senate and it was labelled obscene. Not classified, but it was labelled obscene. Now this eavesdropping data showed the fact that he would go to these cities where he would have these speeches, he would hire all kinds of prostitutes and have orgies in his hotel room. A Baptist pastor! The wonderful moral civil rights leader, Doctor, Oh I’m sorry, The Reverend Doctor MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was hiring prostitutes in city after city and having perverted orgies in the hotel room with these prostitutes. \r\n\r\nNewscaster Chris Hayes: “Today, New York Times magazine published for the very first time a full, unredacted letter sent to King in 1964, which until now has only been available to the public with significant redactions. It’s an utterly shocking document. A letter accuses king of being quote “A filthy abnormal animal, who's engaged in sexual orgies at odds of his claims of morality, with dirty, evil companions, male and female giving expression with you to your hideous abnormalities. The truth is that it was really written by one of J. Edgar Hoover’s own top men, William Sullivan, the head of the FBI’s intelligence operations. Well according to Tim Weiner’s "History of the FBI" … had a package of the King sex tapes prepared by the FBI’s lab technicians, wrote an accompanying poison-pen letter, and sent both to King’s home. Sullivan’s letter ends with what seems like for King, a call for King to kill himself. “King, there is only one thing left for you to do, you know what it is.” says the letter ominously. “There is but one way out for you, you better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation.” How did you find this thing? \r\n\r\nBeverly Gage: I really just happened upon it. So the letter itself has been known for about 40 years at this point. But we’ve only seen it in the sort of redacted versions. And I was going through a new set of Hoover’s official and confidential files which were really the secret files which he kept in his office. They had been reprocessed they were finally turned over to the national archives and I was amazed to see this letter there finally with all of the redactions removed. \r\n\r\nPSA: Now I’ve got a copy of the letter right here. This is the letter that the FBI sent to MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR… \r\n\r\n(Reading…) “In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavior I will not dignify your name with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. And, your last name calls to mind only the type of King such as King Henry the VIII and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast. No person can overcome facts, not even a fraud like yourself.Lend your sexually psychotic ear to the enclosure. You will find yourself in all your dirt, filth, evil and moronic talk exposed on the record for all time. I repeat — no person can argue successfully against facts. You are finished. You will find on the record for all time your filthy, dirty, evil companions, male and females giving expression with you to your hideous abnormalities. And some of them to pretend to be ministers of the Gospel. Satan could not do more. What incredible evilness. It is all there on the record, your sexual orgies. Listen to yourself you filthy, abnormal animal. (Audience of PSA: “Haha”) You are on the record. You have been on the record — all your adulterous acts, your sexual orgies extending far into the past. This one is but a tiny sample.” \r\n\r\nPSA: They sent him an audio recording with the letter. \r\n\r\n(Reading…) “You will understand this. Yes, from your various evil playmates on the east coast to others on the west coast and outside the country you're on the record. King you are done.\t\r\n\r\nThe American public, the church organizations that you have been helping — Protestant, Catholic and Jews will know you for what you are — an evil, abnormal beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. \r\n\r\nKing, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do it (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significance). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation." \r\n\r\nPSA: So guess what happened, he didn’t kill himself. So guess what they did? 34 days later, they gave it to the media! Guess what the media did? Total media blackout. No one would print it. No one would report … \r\n\r\nPSA: This from the Washington Post, by Richard Cohen, let me just read for you this article entitled “What if the FBI had succeeded in exposing MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.?" The FBI bugs of King’s home and hotel rooms had become common knowledge in news rooms around the country. But here’s the thing, no one printed a word of it. Are you getting this? This article in the Washington Post is saying “Isn’t it so wonderful that when the FBI delivered all this smut that MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was into to the media and said “Hey you need to expose this guy, that everybody is looking up to as a great leader, for the filthy pervert that he is,” no one in the media would print a word of it. Now it's not because they respected the personal lives of... No, you know what it was? They were receiving orders not to print it (Congregation: “yeah!”) because the media is controlled (Congregation: “Yup! That’s right!”) Because the media is not a free press, that’s why (Congregation: “Amen!”) because they were being controlled and were not allowed to print it that’s what's really is going on. \r\n\r\nBut this guy says, 'he was saved from ignominy', no he wasn’t, just because people don't know about it God knows about it. (Congregation: “Right!”) And in 2014 everybody now knows about it. 'He was preserved for greatness', not in my book. I don’t think that a filthy pervert and a false prophet is a great man for one second. The article goes on to say “I can’t help wondering what would have happened if King would have been exposed at the time. The cries of hypocrisy would have blinded the sun. A minister, a civil rights leader, a married man, a father." Yeah, those are good questions. Why is this man such a hypocrite? "The result would be the hideous destruction of a great man." How can you destroy a great man just by shining the light on the fact that he is committing adultery with prostitutes in every place? “Well I don’t just think any of that's true, that’s just a bunch of scuttle-butt.” Right…the Washington Post, the New York Times, the FBI, the senate, they’re all just creating this elaborate conspiracy theory, no, even his friends admitted it. \r\n\r\nListen to this: Ralph David Abernathy; which is one of his fellow reverends that he ran with. He said in his 1989 autobiography 'And The Walls come Tumbling Down', that MARTIN LUTHER KING engaged in extramarital affairs, evidence of which was sometimes recorded by the FBI through hotel room bugs. This is his buddy in the civil rights movement, Reverend Ralph Abernathy. Here’s a quote from his book: “I remember in particular a stay at the Willard Hotel in Washington, where they not only put in audio receivers but video equipment as well. Then, after collecting enough of this evidence to be useful, they began to distribute it to reporters, law officers, and other people in a position to hurt us. Finally, when no one would do Hoover’s dirty work for him, someone in the FBI put together a tape of highly intimate moments, and sent them to Martin. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately and perhaps this was deliberate, his wife Coretta received the tape and played it first. Such accusations never seemed to touch her. She rose above all the petty attempts to damage their marriage by refusing to even entertain such thoughts.” Right, you know even just those “petty attempts”, those “petty attempts” to hurt someone’s marriage, like when you send them a cassette tape of their husband committing adultery with hundreds of different people in hotel rooms across America. You know just little stuff like that that doesn’t really matter anyway. She didn’t let little stuff like that get her down, what a wonderful wife. (Congregation: “yeah…”) I mean what in the world, you know sometimes I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone. Now you might ask yourself as I’m preaching this sermon “Why was the FBI eavesdropping in MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.?” And the answer is Because of him being connected with Communists. (Congregation: “yeah!”) \r\n\r\nDom: Civil Rights activists, Bayard Rustin, served as King’s main advisor and mentor in the late 1950s. He had joined the Young Communist League in 1936 and continued working with the communist Party USA until the early 1940s. Following directions from the Soviet Union, the Communist Party USA and its members were active in the Civil Rights movement for African Americans. Following Stalin’s theory of nationalism, the Communist Party USA or CPUSA once favored the creation of a separate nation for blacks, to be located in the south of the United States, however, after 1941 when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin ordered the CPUSA to abandon Civil Rights Work and to focus on getting the US to enter World War II. Disillusioned, Rustin began working with members of the Socialist party instead. Rustin was a homosexual, who was arrested in Pasadena in 1953 for committing sodomy in the car with two other men. He pleaded guilty to the crime of sex perversion and served 60 days in jail as a punishment. \r\n\r\nPSA: Now those were the good old days when sodomy was a crime. (Congregation: “Amen!!”) In 1953 even in California, he was arrested for sodomy and notice, he was an advisor and mentor, I’m sorry, he was the main advisor and mentor to MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. in the late 50s. When was he arrested and convicted of sodomy? In the early 50s. When is he the main advisor and mentor of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.? In the late 50s. So MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. has with him this known former Communist and homosexual as his main mentor and advisor in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. \r\n\r\nDom: Another of King’s trusted advisors was a Jewish New York lawyer named Stanley Levison, who was a leader of the Communist Party USA in the 1950s. Yet another of King’s advisors and director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was Jack O’Dell. During the 1950s Jack O’Dell was a member of the Communist Party USA. Both president John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy tried to persuade MARTIN LUTHER KING to separate himself from the known communists in his organization, but he would not heed the warning. \r\n\r\nPSA: On October 10, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation to being wiretapping the telephones of the reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. Kennedy believed that one of King’s closest advisors was a top-level member of the American Communist Party. And look, this wasn’t some right-wing conservative that said “Let’s wiretap MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.”. It was Robert Kennedy! (Congregation: “Hahaha”) The Kennedys were liberal. And even they said “We need to wiretap MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. because of this Communist connection”, but they ended up getting all of this smut and filth of his wickedness and adulteries. Here’s what a woman named Julia Brown who was a Communist in Cleveland for 9 years said: “We were told to promote King, to unite Negros and Whites behind him, and to turn him into some sort of national hero. We were to look to King as the leader in this struggle the Communist said, because he was on our side. While in the party, I learned that King attended a Communist training school, that several of his aides were communist, and that he received funds from Communists, and took directions from them, he was one of their biggest heroes.” Look, it's a fact, he attend the Highlander Folk School, which was a Communist Training School. These are facts. He was a Communist. He was a pervert. He was an adulterer. He was a false prophet. But other than that he was a great guy. (Congregation: “Hahahaha!”) Think about that man. It doesn’t make any sense. So eventually we all know how MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. met his end, he was assassinated. The assassination was supposedly carried out by a man named James Earl Ray, but James Earl Ray never received a jury trial. Even MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.’s own family believes that he was not the killer. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.’s son went and visited James Earl Ray in prison and walked away believing him that he was not the killer. \r\n\r\nFredricka Whitfield: “Dexter King arrived at this national prison to meet the man serving time for the death of his father, Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING." \r\n\r\nDexter King: "Long anticipated, visit.." \r\n\r\nFredricka Whitfield: "The Youngest son wanted to look into the eyes of a terminally ill James Earl Ray and ask one question in particular.." \r\n\r\nDexter King: "Did you kill my father?" \r\n\r\nJames Earl Ray: "No, No I didn’t, No." \r\n\r\nFredricka Whitfield: "And then King offered this:" \r\n\r\nDexter King: “I believe you. And my family believes you.” \r\n\r\nMatt Lauer: "Dexter King good morning to you." \r\n\r\nDexter King: "Good morning." \r\n\r\nMatt Lauer: "Take me back to the moment when you reached out and shook James Earl Ray’s hand, what was that like?" \r\n\r\nDexter King: "It was very moving. A feeling of relief to finally meet face to face with the man who has been accused of but has since from the beginning said he was innocent. I continue to hear that he confessed and in fact he didn’t confess, he plead guilty which is different technically speaking." \r\n\r\nMatt Lauer: "So when you asked him “Did you kill my father?” in no uncertain times and he said “No I did not” why do you believe him?" \r\n\r\nDexter King: "Well I believe him because there’s so much new evidence that has been presented to me and my family vis-à-vis his attorney Bill Pepper. Also the fact of the matter is, he has said from the beginning he was innocent and I asked him why he plead guilty. He said basically, his attorney at the time cut a deal behind the scenes with the district attorney and unbeknownst to him, he was forfeiting his rights to a trial.. as soon as he found that out. Three days later, he recanted and has since been trying to get a trial. " \r\n\r\nPSA: So his defense attorney told him this: “If you go to trial you’re going to be convicted and you’re going to be put to death” because of he would've been convicted in court, he would have been put to death. So they pressured him and convinced him to plead guilty and then you won’t get the death penalty, you’ll get life in prison instead. So that’s what he did. Three days later, he regretted it, regretted it for the rest of his life, fought to try to get a jury trial, then MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.’s own family fought to try to get him a jury trial and they wanted him to get that jury trial. He never got the jury trial. Jane Pauley: "One week after the meeting, on the eve of the 29th anniversary of the assassination, Today’s Matt Lauer spoke with Pulitzer prize winning King biographer David Garrow." \r\n\r\nMatt Lauer: "You said that the scene of James Earl Ray and Dexter King shaking hands was quote “sad and surreal” … why?" \r\n\r\nDavid Garrow: "Yes Matt, I think it’s very sad that the King family and the King children are so uninformed of the history that they could be open to believing that Mr. Ray was not involved in Dr. King’s assassination." \r\n\r\nMatt Lauer: "Alright hang on for one second because joining us now is Dexter King, Dexter good morning to you." \r\n\r\nDexter King: "Good morning." \r\n\r\nMatt Lauer: "Mr. Garrow seems to think that you and your family members are being duped by James Earl Ray and his attorneys, what’s your reaction?" \r\n\r\nDexter King: "Well, I’m very disturbed by his comments that anyone in this day and age of victim’s rights would suggest that it is wrong for a family to question who killed their loved one. The fact of the matter is, I guess I’m really not surprised because Mr. Garrow, for whatever reason, is doing his job and frankly he is an agent for those forces of suppression who do not want this truth come forward." \r\n\r\nPSA: You say “Well why do you bring that up about James Earl Ray? Why is that relevant?” Well because of the fact that I believe that the reason that MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was assassinated is because they wanted him to be a martyr that would go down in history with greatness and if he would have been allowed to continue living, he would have ruined his own reputation, because he’s going around committing all this filth. And so they figure “We better take this guy out while he’s at the top of his game, before he gets busted with all the filth, and before he does something really stupid that we can’t cover for him anymore, and we can’t have a media blackout anymore” so I think they took him out in order to immortalize him. \r\n\r\nPeter Jennings: "President Reagan signed into law a bill today creating a national holiday honoring MARTIN LUTHER KING.. ABC’s Sam Donaldson was at the white house. Sam Donaldson: "The White House staged an impressive ceremony today, the president and Dr. King’s widow walking into the Rose Garden together, in an effort to spruce up Mr. Reagan’s tattered civil rights image. The president signed the bill which he had so strongly opposed, making MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.’s birthday a national holiday. When it was over Mrs. King said it had been a great day, and the president’s words were fitting. The Reverend Jesse Jackson who is running for president said it was not a day for him to criticize anyone." \r\n\r\nPSA: A national holiday was proclaimed in honor of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. Starting on October 8, 1983 there were debates on the senate floor about the King Holiday. And let me just point out to you the word “holiday” means “Holy Day”. That’s what holiday means. Do we need a holy day for MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.? I mean does this man sound like he was a holy man? And in these debates there were of course people who brought out all the smut and the filth and all the 64 thousand pages that the senate had received, and then the other side basically just said: “Well how dare you run this smear campaign.” Just want to just ignore the facts of all of this filth and smut that was proven by hard evidence and of course the King Holiday came about why? Because of the fact that if you don’t like Dr. King you’re a racist! And by the way, if you don’t like Obama, you’re also a racist! (Congregation: “Right!”) I mean that’s what these people believe, don’t they? People will just try to tell you “Shut up about MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. you vicious racist” I do not have a racist bone in my body. Anyone who knows me can verify that. \r\n\r\nBut yet you're called a racist for criticizing Obama, for criticizing MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., we’re just judging people on the content of their character folks! (Congregation: “Right!”) Nothing to do with color! People who don't have any facts want to make it about color, and play that race card. (Congregation: “Yeah!”) Now listen, I grew up in Christian school, and I went to a lot of different Christian schools, Baptist schools, and none of them ever gave us the day off for MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. day and we never complained about it one time. Because our parents taught us that that holiday was something we do not observe as Christians because he was a wicked false prophet and an adulterer and a communist and when I was growing up, MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was known in my house as “Marxist Lucifer King”. That’s how he was referred to in my house. Marxist because was a communist, Lucifer because he was of the devil. The bible says that Satan’s ministers are transformed into ministers of light. \r\n\r\n“And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.” 2 Corinthians 11:14-15 KJV \r\n\r\nPSA: But today even Baptists even Christians have been so brainwashed by TV and media that they exalt this man whom they know nothing about, just because everybody else is doing it. And the bible says “They that forsake the law praise the wicked but for such as keep the law, contend with them”. Now you say “Pastor Anderson, what’s the message of this sermon? What are we going to do next Monday? What’s the celebration?” You know who I am going to celebrate next Monday? Jesus! (Congregation: “AMEN!”) Because Jesus is the real hero of racial equality that we ought to be celebrating. If you want to celebrate the third Monday in every January as a day of remembering someone who did the most to bring people together of all nations, and ethnicities, you ought to be celebrating the Lord Jesus Christ (Congregation: “AMEN!”) here’s what Jesus said: \r\n\r\nDom: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” John 10:16 KJV \r\n\r\nPSA: And when he said that, you know what he was referring to? He said other sheep that are not of the Jews, sheep that are of the gentiles, I’m going to bring them and there’s going to be one fold and there’s going to be one shepherd, and my house shall be a house of prayer to all nations. (AMEN!). And let me tell you something, the place where red and yellow black and white can come together and have unity and be brothers and sisters is in the local church! (Congregation: “AMEN!”) That’s where we’ll be united. That’s where we can come together and realize that we’re all of one blood. That’s where we’re taught that our brother and our sisters are red and yellow black and white because we are God’s children only if we believe on the lord Jesus Christ (Congregation: “Amen!”) The bible says “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name”. (Congregation: “Amen”) And we are brothers and sisters in Christ today in the local church. \r\n\r\nDominique: “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.” 1 Corinthians 12:13 KJV \r\n\r\n“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” Galatians 3:28 KJV PSA: The Bible says “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.” Acts 10:34-35 KJV \r\n\r\n(AMEN!) That’s the answer tonight. We don’t need MARTIN LUTHER KING. You say “Well if we don’t have MARTIN LUTHER KING, you know then basically all the blacks are going to go back into slavery and we’re all going to be segregated and everything…” We don’t need MARTIN LUTHER KING. You know what that movement should have done is lifted up Jesus as their leader (Congregation: “Right!”) and they should have made these bible verses their slogan and chanted these slogans and said “We shall overcome...by believing that Jesus is the SON OF GOD” (Congregation: “AMEN!”) That’s how we’re going to overcome the race problem is when we realize that we’re all related through Christ. (Congregation: “Amen!”) Because we believe in Jesus. And you know what? I have a lot more in common, and I have a lot more fellowship, and I have a lot more affection for my brothers and sisters in Christ no matter what their nationality than even my flesh and blood relatives that are not saved. (Congregation: “AMEN!”) I’m not going to stick together with the white people you know “We white people need to stick together” and “We black people need to stick together” and “We Hispanics need to stick … “ No no no, I’m sticking together with God’s people, (Congregation: “AMEN! That’s right!”) That’s where my loyalty is. My loyalty is to Jesus and to his children (Congregation: “That’s right!”) and nationality means nothing! Do not be deceived my friend. Many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, this is a deceiver and an antichrist.

516	Once Saved Always Saved	Pastor Anderson	2014-02-23 17:30:00	20140223A_OnceSavedAlwaysSaved.mp3	hycjHApNNOM	https://soundcloud.com/bible-preaching/2014-02-23a-once-saved-always	t	Faithful Word Baptist Church	Now in 1 john 5 the part that I want to focus on is beginning there in verse 10, where the bible reads “He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. \r\n\r\nThe title of my sermon tonight is Once saved always saved. It’s about the eternal security of the believer, the fact that once we get saved there is nothing we can ever do to lose our salvation. Now usually when you hear the term once saved always saved, it is out of the mouth of people that are criticizing that doctrine, oh you're one of the those once saved always but you know I’ll just embrace it, I think it is a great way to explain what we believe and a great term to break, and all throughout the bible and all throughout history derogatory terms that have been used against God’s people have been embraced by God’s people. For example they were called christians by others, you know they were called baptists in the middle ages many times for rebaptizing people after they just been sprinkled as babies. You know people will attack us and use terms like easy believers as once saved always saved, I say to all of it amen. \r\n\r\nI am a baptist, I’m christian, once saved always saved, easy believers. It’s easy to be saved you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved, and you know what it’s the hard part that was done by Jesus on the cross. I mean how hard is it to get saved? Well as hard as it is to take a drink of water, as hard as eating a piece of bread, it’s as hard as opening a door and walking through it, it’s as hard as calling on the name of the Lord. That’s what the bible teaches. \r\n\r\nNow I want to prove this to you from the bible in many different scriptures that we can never lose our salvation and not only that i’m going to turn to some of the scriptures that people will try to use to say that you can lose you it and show why that just doesn’t hold water but the first thing I want to point out is in 1 john 5 is the part that is probably the most controversial, a lot of baptist don’t agree with this most independant baptist probably wouldn’t agree with this but I make no apology for it, it’s what I have always preached, it’s what I have believed since I was a child, I’ll stand on it now, this church has always stood on it, if you do not believe in eternal security , if you do not believe in once saved always saved, your not saved. You know and a lot of people would agree with that but that’s what the bible teaches right here because of the fact when you talk to the people that believe you can lose their salvation, here is what it comes down to thy ar trusting in their works to save them. Cause when you are trusting faith alone, you know when you are trusting Jesus alone you know you can’t lose it. \r\n\r\nLook what the bible teaches in 1 john 5:10 it says “He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself” now if you get the context thats talking about the holy spirit because it talks about that there are three that bear record in heaven, three that bar witness in the earth. The witness that abides in us if we are saved, is the holy spirit of God, it says “he that that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave us his Son. So from that verse we can tell that there are two kind of people in this world. There are those that believe on the son of God and those who are making God a liar and why are they making God a liar because they do not believe the record that God gave of his Son and then he tells us what that record in verse 11 “and this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.” \r\n\r\nlook thats what you have to believe to be saved, verse 11 is the record that you must believe in ordinary to be saved and if you do not believe that record you are making God a liar. and there are three elements i want to point out about that record quickly, “and this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life” number 1 it says he has given it to us it is a gift. The bible says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast. So in order to be saved you have to believe that it’s a gift, you can’t try and earn your way into heaven and do it by works, you have to do it by faith alone and just receive that fr gift of eternal life. So he says you have to believe the record God has given number 1 it’s a gift. Number 2 he has given us what? eternal life. What does eternal mean? it never ends, so therefore if you don’t believe that God gave us eternal life, then you're not saved. So if you think God just saved us temporary, you’re not saved. The bible says you have to believe that God has given us eternal life, and the third thing is that this life is in his Son, you gotta believe that it’s through his Jesus Christ. These are the three elements that are found in verse 11. \r\n\r\nAnd he says in verse 13 ‘These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.” Now nothing when he says “have eternal life’ he didn’t say had, past tense that be you lost it. He didn’t say will get you know like you wait till heaven to find out. He says you can know you have eternal life, not look just before I get into all the multitude of scriptures that teach you, you can not lose your salvation, first let’s just look at the word eternal that says everything right there. Eternal means never ending, it come from a root word like terminate right. termination eternal and the E at the beginning is a negating prefix, and so eternal means no ending. It has a synonym in the bible everlasting. So let me ask you this if I have life today that never ends, if I have today on february 23rd eternal life and down the road at some point I were to lose it was it ever eternal? No because it ended. So if I have eternal life today that means it can never end because by definition that’s what eternal life even is. Otherwise it would make no sense. \r\n\r\nBut turn if you would to matthew chapter seven first of all, matthew chapter number 7 we see that we have eternal life, we can know that we have eternal life. Jesus also said in john 6:47 “verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.” again present tense, that you have it right now if you believe on Christ meaning that it is gonna last forever. You can’t lose it but look at matthew 7:21 it says “Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven” I’m gonna show you in just a moment what the will of the father is but let me start out by saying this saying Lord, lord doesn’t get you into heaven. If saying Lord, Lord were enough then this verse would not be true. Is saying Lord to God enough to get you into heaven? No. You have to do the will of the father which is in heaven, which I am going to show you in a moment what that is but look what he says next “Many will say to me in that day Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Now let me point out first of all that he didn’t say I use to know you, not if you could lose your salvation, if these people have once been saved and then lost their salvation could he really say to them I never knew you if he used to know them? No. So this right here shows that the people that are going to be damned on judgment day, who think they are saved but really aren’t, are not people that lost their salvation that’s not possible. It’s people who are trusting in what’s the last word of verse 22? works. The people who are trusting in their works Jesus says to them “ I never knew you” not i used to know you because you can’t lose it. The never had it in the first place, now look if you were to stand before God right now and God were to ask you why should I let you into heaven? would you say I have done many wonderful works? absolutely not, no bible believing christian, no one that understands salvation is by grace through faith would ever say but God how can you not be letting me in when I have done so many wonderful works. The only person who would say such a thing is one that thinks their works has something to do with getting them into heaven. \r\n\r\nLook what their listing we prophesied in it, we preached in it, we've done wonderful works in it, we have cast out devils in your name. Look are these people claiming the name of Jesus? Yeah. Have they called Jesus Lord? Yeah. Are the doing a lot of wonderful works in Jesus name? Yeah. So why in the world are they cast out? Why are they not allowed into heaven? because anyone who trusted in their works is not saved. The bible says it’s not of works lest any man should boast. Boasting like what? Boasting like I have done many wonderful works. I have done many wonderful works, I have prophesied in your name and cast out devils of course they are going to let me in. no flesh shall glory in his presence. Jesus paid it all, all to him we owe. Sin has left a crimson stain, he washed white as snow. We have nothing to boast of salvation is grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the bible is teaching us crystal clear in this passage that if you go to hell he never knew you and if you are trusting in your works even if you are saying I believe in Jesus, I’m doing it in the name of Jesus but you say I am going to heaven because of my works, you're not saved thats what the bible teaches. \r\n\r\nNow lets look at the will of the father because a lot of people will get confused they’ll see the will of the father in verse 21 and say see you have to do the works. Well these people did the works but go to John chapter six, let’s see what the will of the father is, and also coincidentally john chapter six is another great passage that proves that you can’t lose your salvation. In several different verses but the bible says in john 6:35 “and Jesus said unto them,” now before I read this what would you say when you got there and Jesus is telling you, you can’t come into heaven? You know what I would say is ‘wow wait a minute I believed in you, you says who so ever believed in him should not perish but have eternal life, you said it’s by faith we are saved, you said if I confess with my mouth the lord Jesus and believed with my heart God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. what’s the deal is that not true?” I wouldn’t be talking about my works. I wouldn’t be bragging about my works because my works and my righteousness are nothing, they are filthy rags before God. It’s gotta be by grace through faith. Now look what it says in John 6:35 “ Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me “ we he might hungr in the future, I mean what does it say? “he that cometh to me shall never hunger:” you see how salvation is a one time thing? You come to Jesus Christ you eat of the bread of life that he gives you and he says “ you shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.” It’s the same thing that he said to the women at the well in chapter four when he said “ if you drink of this water you will thirst again, if you drink of the water I give you, it’ll be a well water springing up inside of you unto everlasting life, you’ll never thirst again.” And it says in verse 36 “ But I say unto you, That ye also have seen me and believed not.” So he is talking about people who have not believed. “All that the father give unto me shall come to me and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.” Another great verse about not losing your salvation. He says you guys have to believe but one that comes to me I will in no wise cast out. Verse 38 ‘For I come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” and this is the father’s will because remember in matthew seven he said you have to do the will of the father? What does it mean to do someone's will? Do what they want, that’s a perfect definition. If I said I want you, If I said to my son I want you to do my will, that means you're going to do what I want, we are going to do it my way. So look if you get into heaven you're not getting there man’s way, your getting there God’s way. That’s why it says in John 1:12 “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.“ It’s God’s will that matters in regards to salvation, not man’s will and what does it say here? This is the father’s will which has sent me that if all, that which I that he has given to me I should lose nothing another get proof that we can not lose our salvation but should raise it up again at the last day. Now watch another aspect of the father's will in verse 40” And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day” So what’s the will of the father? That people will see the Lord Jesus Christ, believe on him and be raised up at the last day. What is the will of the father according to verse 39 and 40? That people would believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and that none of them would be lost, none of them would ever lose their salvation and that they would be raised up at the last day. Now look you can not lose your salvation he said in verse 37 him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. Once you have been saved you have past from death to life. \r\n\r\nGo to chapter five just flip back one page, so doing the will of the father which is in heaven is not just saying in every area of life, you are always doing God’s will, all the time keeping every commandment. You know if they were keeping every commandment that saves us, none of us would be saved. Not one because there is not a just man upon the earth that doeth good and sinneth not. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. As it is written there is none righteous no not one. No one will be justified by the works of the law. No one will be justified by keeping the commandments but it says in john 5:24 “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life,” again present tense that means it’s gonna last forever and if it doesn’t that means you never had everlasting life. Now what’s so silly about this thing where they say well you might have everlasting life today but you might lose it tomorrow, not only is that completely illogical because that didn’t last forever but it could only last one day. Not only is that completely illogical but when you stop and think about God knows the future and you stop and think about the fact God knows everything and God knows how your life is going to go he knows the end from the beginning. To sit there and think he knows you're going to lose it but says its everlasting anyways, he knows you're going to lose it but calls it eternal that’s nonsense. It makes no sense but he says here” the one who believes has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation;”you will not be condemned. He doesn’t say you're never gonna sin again, but you're not going to be condemned is what he is saying, and then he says this “but is passed from death unto life.” I mean that’s just a powerful statement about the fact we are saved eternally, we will not be condemned, we have passed from death unto life. \r\n\r\nGo back to chapter 3 because in chapter 3 we find a very powerful scripture. That kinda ties in with when Jesus said “I never knew you.” Look at john 3:18 here is another verse that proves you can’t lose your salvation. John 3:18 says “He that believeth on him (talking about Jesus Christ) is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.” Notice the past tense, he hath not believed on the only begotten Son of God. There are two kinds of people in this world those who believe and those who do not believe. Notice what he says about those that do not believe, thou hath not believed, thy never believed but once you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you are saved, you are a believer. You are sealed with the holy Ghost you can not lose your salvation. If you could lose your salvation verse 18 wouldn’t make any sense. To put it into two categories like that those who believe and those that hath not believed. \r\n\r\nNow let’s think about it, lets say you can lose your salvation right, and let's say a guy believed on Christ and then down the road he stops believing, he loses his salvation, whatever you want to call it right. Well then he wouldn’t fall into any of these categories. Cause he neither believes but you could not say he never believed because he did back then. See how this doesn’t make any sense because it is not true because once you believe you are saved, your sealed, and your secure. \r\n\r\nBut let’s flip over to John 10 I just wanna go through all the stuff in the book of John while were here. We saw three back to back powerful evidence in chapter 6, just back to back to back that you can’t lose your salvation just in the space of a couple verses. We saw chapter 5 verse 24, th verse that was shown me when I got saved as a six year old boy. We saw john 3:18 another powerful verse that shows, you have either not believed it or you are still believing it and you're still saved and you still have everlasting life. The we seen John 10:28 “ And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. “ He says you're in Jesus Christ’s hand and you’re in the father’s hand and nobody is going to pluck you out of that hand. \r\n\r\nNow flip over to chapter 11, one time I had somebody say this to me I was out soul winning and you know I was preaching eternal life to someone and they said this to me. They said this “well it’s like this you're holding his hand and he’s holding your hand and he is never gonna let go of you but you can let go of him is what they thought. Okay so come up here John, come on up here for a second John. Let’s see if this holds, come up here John, let’s see if this holds water okay. So let’s use this illustration that I was given by somebody who believes you can lose your salvation. Okay so let’s go here, I am holding his hand right, and I am never going to let go of his hand but he can let go of my hand right okay. So go ahead John let go of my hand John go ahead and let go son, let go, go back to your seat son, let go no remember you can let go, i’m not going to let go but he can let go, he can let go anytime he wants to. Right? Right? So you get the point right? I don’t let go it doesn’t matter if he lets go, he can hold on as tight as he wants, he can let go, he can try to pull it out but guess what i’m stronger then him and that’s why he could not go and the bible says you’re my father which gave to me is greater than all. God is stronger than you so if you were to have this hypothetical tug-a-war with God like “ let me go, let me go” he is not going to let go because he said no one can pluck you out of his hand because his hand is so strong, you can’t get out. \r\n\r\nGo if you would to John 11 there verse 25 it says “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die” now this is a powerful verse for those who try to twist the definition of eternal life, some people will say “well eternal life it doesn’t mean it goes on forever it’s just talking about the quality of your life. You know it’s a type of life, a style of life you know it’s a quality of life” you know okay what about never dying? Because eternal life in equated with never dying, which proves it, which people will say ”if you go back into the greek and you look at the word eternal it’s aionion you know like eon” because you know someone will say something happened eons ago like eon” and they say “eon just means a really long time.” So that’s what Jesus went around preaching, you’re gonna live for a really long time, if you believe on me you're going to live for a long time. But what about people that would lose it according to these people they could lose it a week later,two weeks later, six months later. Now is that an eon? Now does anyone know long is an eon? I don’t know, I don’t think anyone, ok thats way to much information hahaha. Four eons equals 13 billions years, haha whatever, that was over my head. These homeschooled kids I tell ya. But what I am saying is that doesn’t make any sense but but this whole thing of going to a foreign language, well nobody can really, I mean how do you dispute that unless you knew greek and how many people in here are fluent in greek? You know, so basically people through that at you, well if you go back to the greek, you know it’s aionion, and that’s like eon, and that’s like blah blah. You don’t know whether that’s really true. You know what I think that greek word means? Eternal. And you how I can prove that’s what it means? Because Jesus compared it to never die. So if he puts on this side live forever, everlasting life, eternal life, and over here he said never die, I think you get the picture. Those are both the same thing shall not perish but have everlasting life, makes perfect sense. So here he says “ whosoever liveth and believeth in me” so if you're here and you live and you believe you will never die, that is what the bible teaches. \r\n\r\nLet’s go to 2 corinthians, actually you go to ephesians 1, I will go to 2 corinthians because another great teaching besides all the stuff we seen in the book of John, besides just the word eternal life, besides just the idea that he will never leave us nor forsake us, besides the idea that I never knew you, besides the idea those who believe have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God, besides all that. There is also the doctrine in the new testament that we are sealed with the holy spirit until the day of redemption. Now in second corinithians 1:22 it says “ Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.” so the bible says when we are saved, God seal’s us and gives us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts. Now what is the earnest? Well you remember the comic when you were a kid Frank and Earnest? Anybody ever read that comic? What does Earnest mean? Serious, earnest means serious. If I say something to you in earnest, it means that I was being serious if I say something to you in jest it means I was not being serious. So when the bible says here God has given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts, an earnest as a noun cause obviously earnest is an adjective when we say you know doing something in earnest okay that would not be an adjective. But if I say he has a very earnest life style, he is very serious okay. This is a noun, the earnest and what an earnest is, is a down payment on something to show that you are serious about buying it. Okay so for example let’s say there is a house for sale and I am going to put down some, put down an offer on that house but let’s say their asking a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and I say I will give you an hundred and forty thousand and just to show you that I am serious, I am going to put down a thousand down in earnest money. Anyone who has bought a house has heard of earnest money and you put you know I am going to put down a thousand dollars as earnest money just to show that I am not playing games because otherwise people be like I am going to give you a hundred and forty thousand like okay, you know psych. You know so the whole point is you know you put down the earnest money maybe like five thousand earnest money just to show that you’re serious okay. It’s a down payment. What God is saying here is that he sealed us and he gave us the earnest of the holy spirit showing that were saved, showing that we will have eternal life, showing that we're going to go to heaven and be with him eternally, he gives us that down payment of the spirit now the reason that the spirit is called the earnest is or the down payment is because we are not fully redeemed when we get saved because our body has not been redeemed. Now our soul and spirit have already been saved but has our body been saved? I mean did your body transform when you got, the moment you believed on christ ? Anything change about your body? Did it become perfect? Did it become righteous? No, your flesh is the same but at the resurrection, at what’s called the rapture. The bible says in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we will be changed and the bible says that we are waiting for that day, to wait the redemption of our body. The bible calls the rapture the redemption of our body okay. So we haven’t go the whole package of salvation, we have not experienced all the benefits of salvation yet but we have the earnest of the spirit. The full benefit of our salvation will be when we get rid of this flesh and we have a brand new glorified body and were in heaven with Christ. Then we will have the full benefit of salvation at that time. Until then we have the earnest of the spirit in our heart, showing that God is serious, showing that God is going to do what he said. The bible said he begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ, the day of Christ is another name for the rapture. The Lord is coming in the clouds. \r\n\r\nLook if you would at ephesians 1 there, it says in verse twelve “That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. “ Now what does it mean to trust in Christ? That’s putting our faith in Christ, that’s believing on Christ, said in the next verse “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.” There is so much packed into these verse here first of all it helps to define what it means to believe on Christ, to trust Christ, to put our faith in Christ, to believe he is the one who is going to save us, not trusting in our works but trusting in Christ but he says here that the holy spirit of promise. What promise? The bible says in hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began. Still not convinced? First John 2:25 “And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life” The bible says the promise of God is eternal life, the promise of God is eternal redemption in glory and the bible says you are sealed unto the holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance. So do we have more coming? Absolutely I mean the inheritance gonna be huge, he that overcometh shall inherit all things the bible says I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son. We will inherit all things, we are joint heirs with Jesus Christ, we will inherit the kingdom of God . We will be redeemed in the body, we will receive a glorified body. And the bible says here that the holy spirit is the earnest of our inheritance until we mess up, until we sin, until we lose faith, until we let go, until we walk away, until we lose our salvation no. It says until the redeemption of the purchased possession because which which has begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. It’s not that he might preform it, he might back out, he might break his promise, he might put down the earnest of money and say no I changed my mind no. He is serious, he has made a promise, he will redeem us body, soul and spirit. We will inherit all things and just to guarantee that we will inherit, just to guarantee that we will be saved, just to guarantee we will inherit eternal life amd he won’t break his promise he gave us that down payment, he gave us the earnest of the spirit and he sealed us unto the day of redemption. \r\n\r\nGo to chapter 4 verse 30 same book but I mean we just saw it in ephesians 1, he refers back to ephesians 1 in chapter 4 verse 30 when he says and grieve not the holy spirit of God or else you’ll lose your salvation, is that what he said? no because there is no verse in the bible like that instead he said “ And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. “ so even if you do grieve the holy spirit of God you're still sealed unto the day of redemption. Don’t do it don’t grieve him but your sealed, your sealed unto the day of redemption. \r\n\r\nGo to Romans chapter 4, Romans chapter number four. I mean there is so much scripture on this, so much, I mean I am just trying to cram all into one sermon. Just to go over the fact that it is eternal life, just to go over the fact that it is everlasting, just to go over the fact that we shall never die, just to go over the fact that he never knew those who weren’t saved, just to go over the fact that those who do not believe, have not believed, just to go over the fact that we are sealed by the holy spirit of promise unto the day of redemption, which is the earnest of our salvation, just to go over the fact that we have been passed from death unto life and we shall never come into condemnation and now another aspect of eternal life, another aspect of once saved always saved. Romans four teaches that our sins after we are saved are not even imputed unto us, after we are saved the sins we commit are not reckoned unto our account, look at Romans 4:5 “But to him that worketh not,” did you get that? well to him that only does a lit bit of work, is that what it says? “but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the” but well if you have the faith you will have the works still. Is that what this said? This says you work not and believe, there are people that believe but do not have the works. Even, well James 2 faith without works is dead right but if faith without works is dead that means faith without works exists. How can you say faith without works is dead, if it is not possible to have faith without works? People are like well if you have faith you always have works, the two go, you can’t have one without the other, okay well what about faith without works is dead? Exactly. What? Like faith without works is dead would be a meanless statement, if it didn’t exist, faith without works must exist, I mean if I said the dog is dead, doesn’t it mean there is a dog there? I mean I am just trying to, I am just trying to break this down in a way where everybody can understand. I mean I said the dog is dead, well I don’t even have a dog, I don’t even know why I said that. If I say the dog is dead there gotta be a dog there that we are even talking about for it to be dead. So in order for faith without works to be dead that means there has to exists a condition called faith without works okay and James two is talking to be that are saved, he is talking to people that are believers, he says my brethren and he talking, and I have done whole sermons on James two and I am not going to go into all the details because I have already done it too many times, it’s outside the scope of this sermon but guess what if I am saved today which I am, if that means I have faith in Christ right, what if I don’t have any works today? What does James say about my faith? It’s dead. I mean can I really say to you, lets say I did no works for the past week, no works I have just been living in the flesh, I have just been doing, doing the ways of the world and I haven’t following God this week, and I just didn’t go to church and I just didn’t read my bible, didn’t pray I have just been living a worldly life this week. Do I have works? If that’s the life I have been living the past week? No, then you could say my faith is dead. But does that mean I have lost my salvation? No it doesn’t, it just means my faith will not profit anyone else you know if I, it’s all talk unless I have the works to back it up, what does that mean, not talking about getting into heaven but talking about my relationship with my fellow man okay because that’s why the bible says dead no man will be justified by works in the sight of God, but are we justified by works in the sight of man? of course because man can man see my faith? No, man can only see my works, man can not see my faith. So in the sight of man we are justified by works, that’s what James two is talking about and that’s why it talks about Abraham being justified by works when he offered his son unto the altar at a hundred and thirty years old. Are you doing to tell me Abraham got saved when he was 130? No he got saved long before that but he showed his faith to the world in Genesis 22 when he was willing to sacrifice Isaac his son upon the altar, that was an amazing testament of his faith unto men. \r\n\r\nThats why the bible says in verse three chapter four, look at Romans 4:3, I am sorry verse two “For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God” so Abraham was justified by works but not before God. Look at verse five “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.” now what do we see in that? We see the past, present, and the future. I mean think about it a lot of people will say well when you get saved all the sins you did before you got saved those are all forgiven but going forward your responsible for those sins and you need to keep on getting forgiveness, you gotta keep on getting salvation, you gotta keep on getting redemption and their are people who think you have to ask for forgiveness everyday to stay saved. I mean I have talked to them all the time out soul winning, alot of catholics and even a lot of protestants will tell ya you have to ask for forgiveness of your sins everyday or you are not going to be saved. But what does the bible say here? It says the past is covered in verse seven “Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven” and that’s past tense. “whose sins are covered.” that’s a past tense verb and it says “Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin” thats the future. So me today Steven.L.Anderson my sins are covered and forgiven and he is not going to impute sin unto me going forward. I mean isn’t that what the bible says he saves us from our sins past, present and future. \r\n\r\nOtherwise I guess it you’d be best option would be to get saved you know right at the end of your life right on your deathbed and that’s what a lot of catholics do because catholicism teaches that, they just think you know what I want to live it up, I want to be wild, I want to party, I want to sow my wild oats, and then when I get older I am going to go ahead and get it all forgiven and get it all absolved, go to mass everyday. You know I am too old to party anyways at that point so I might as well get up and go to mass every morning and get this all absolved and their gonna split hell wide open because they have not trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ as their saviour. Their trusting in works, their trusting in religion, their trusting in the church instead of in the Lord. \r\n\r\nLook its clear, how can I lose my salvation if God’s not even going to impute my sins unto me according to Romans 4:8 flip over to chapter 8 of Romans, you're in Romans go to chapter 8. Look what it says in Romans 8:33 “Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.” Now God’s not going to lay anything to our charge, man can’t lay anything to our charge, are sins are not imputed unto us. Who is he that condemneth? Remember the verse that says we shall not come into condemnation? We have been past to death unto life? “ Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.” So what Christ did for us is not just past tense. Yes he died, yes he was buried, yes he rose again but he also ever liveth to make intercession for us, to make sure we shall not be condemned, to make sure no one can lay anything to our charge, to make sure sin will not be imputed unto us spiritually going forward, it says he makes intercession for us. “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” \r\n\r\nLet me ask you this if you are justified, if you are saved, if you have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ will God ever stop loving you? Will you ever be separated from his love? No but let me ask you this is it loving for God to send someone to hell? Is that an act of love? Sending someone to the lake of fire is not love, if I love you I am not going to put you in hell and make you burn forever and ever. Now it gets quite because people are like well wait a minute God loves everybody. Yea okay where is that in the bible? Its not there the bible I there, I can show you nineteen scriptures after the service were God says he hates people okay and look God loved past tense, God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever that believe in him should not perish but have eternal life. Look God loved everyhbody, God loves everyone at some point but there comes a point Hosea chapter 7 where he said I will love them no more and there comes a point where when you don’t believe on Jesus Christ and you die without Jesus Christ and your not in the love of God, you are under the wrath of God, you are under God’s wrath. Now look, does God love the unsaved? Yes, Does God love the saved? Yes, but here is the difference, when you are saved he will never stop loving you, nothing can ever separate you from the love of God when you are saved but when you are not saved you can come to a point where he says I love you no more. Where he says you are damned eternally, you are under my wrath and look people for an example blaspheme the Holy Ghost I mean they were done, over and to say that God loves everybody sounds great except that there are 19 scriptures where he clearly talks about hating people and even specifically talks about I will love them no more, I hated them and I will love them no more in the same verse. And so we need to study to show ourselves approved unto God. You know it’s easy to just repeat squawk,squawk, God loves everybody squawk,squawk just repeat things that you’ve heard instead of studying the bible and learning what the bible actually teaches. That is not what the bible actually teaches and so we need to just stop just repeating things we hear and here is another thing people will often do squawk, hate the sin love the sinner, squawk, hate the sin love the sinner. Okay you know who that quote is from Mahatma Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi was not a bible believing christian, Gandhi did not believe on Jesus Christ and he is in hell right now. And he is the one who said hate the sin love the sinner, here, here's what’s funny I would like to do an experiment one time, I’d like to go to christians all across, all across the world and all across america and just show them a couple of quotes and just say which one of these do you think it right and the first thing I will show them is Gandhi’s quote, okay Gandhi’s quote, now I will show him Gandhi’s quote I won’t tell him who it’s from and then I will show them the quote from David, the man after God’s own heart who said “ do not I hate them oh Lord that hate thee, and am not agreed with those that rise up against thee, I hate them with perfect hatred, I count them my enemies” Ask them which one of these is more Christ like? Which one of these is more Christian? Oh Gandhi, oh yes, that’s the quote that they would take and they wouldn’t even recognize the quote from the holy bible. They’d probably say that’s not in the bible, that’s not from the bible, how readeth tho that is in the bible Psalm 139 and so thats kinda sad, that’s kinda off topic from the sermon but my point is, here’s my point and here’s why this is important. If God is never gonna stop loving you, if you are never gonna be separated from his love you're not gonna end up in hell, I mean do you get that? Because look will the Lord chastens us but he will do it because he loves us. The bible says whom the Lord loveth he chastens and scourges every son whom he recieveth, look will I spank my children? yes because I love them, but if I were to kill my children, that’s not love, if I were to send them to hell, that’s not love okay. So we love in this warped mentality were we just repeat stuff we have heard and we just go around saying you know all sins equal, you know it sounds great it’s not biblical and in fact it is borderline insanity and to say all sin is equal. Ya just kill 20 people or steal a pencil same thing, same thing in God’s eyes ah God isn’t a just God then. But guess what God is a just God and all sin is not equal and there is no verse in the bible that says all sin is equal. In fact Jesus looked at Pontius Pilate and said he that delieved me unto thee hath the greater sin. Now how can you have a greater sin if all sin is equal? If God loves everybody how come there are 19 scriptures where God takes about hating people? Sorry to confuse you with the facts, its okay let me just get back to my sermon. \r\n\r\nBut anyways go quickly if you would to Psalm 89 in the old testement, Psalm 89 and the reason I bring these things up is because there are all these false teaching out there that confuse people. Well and look to me some of these teachings just defies logic, like for example saying all sin is equal that defies any reasonable persons mind, that defies anyones logic that has a reasonable mind or saying God loves people that are roasting in hell right now and under, you know he sends people to be tormented for all eternaty because he loves them. How can anyone believe that? That just doesn’t make any sense, I don’t know, I mean what, somebody help me out here. What else do I say to that? I mean God loves everybody but most people burn in hell that doesn’t make any sense. Now yes God loved those people, he died for them, he wanted to save them, he did everything he could and they rejected him finally says I love them no more. You know that makes sense because thats what the bible actually teaches that he doesn’t love people that’s why he sent them to hell because they’re bad because he sent them there because they didn’t get saved because they did not get justified, they didn’t get redeemed and look you say well but he is a loving God. But does that mean he loves everybody? No it doesn’t and to sit there and say all sin is equal is, I mean you’d almost have to be, I mean it be like something you would expect to hear from someone is a mental institution, like if you went to a mental asylum where somebody just thinks well ya I mean killing people is the same as you know just, you know doing whatever just I mean you know jaywalking you know, yeah right. I mean you slap somebody in the face and you gun somebody down. You mean we might think it is different you know but in God’s eyes its as, you know, I mean goodnight but you know what God given us the spirit of a sound mind, if you actually read the bible and get off these man made teachings and again I am getting off target here but lets look at Psalm 89 now I’ll quickly I have already mentioned earlier in John 1:12 “as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: “ so how do we become a son of God? by believing on the name Jesus Christ. Now is everyone a son of God? No because he said we become a son of God when we believe on Christ, so if we become a son of God that means we weren’t one in the past and now we become a son of God by believing in Christ. So when the mormons tell you thats were all Gods children, that just isn’t true because we become sons when we believe in Christ also it says in Galatians chapter 3 verse number 26 it says “ For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus” So were children by faith look at what the bible says in Psalm 89 about the children of God it says in Psalm 89 verse 20 “I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:” Now David in the old testament is a symbolic a lot of times of the Lord Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is known as the son of David and a lot of times he will call Jesus Christ prophetically David my servant also now this passage does have a literal application to David himself but also has a spiritual application towards the Lord Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nLook down at verse 29 I’ll show you what I mean, this is talking about David, “His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.” But if we were to apply this to the Lord Jesus Christ read this passage “His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah Now there is an application there to David physically but hold on a second is David really gonna rule for all eternity on the throne or is it gonna be Jesus Christ who’s gonna sit on the throne of his father David ruling and reigning. \r\n\r\nThe bible says in Isaiah 53 which is a prophetic passage about the Lord Jesus Christ, that he shall see his seed, that Jesus would see his seed and be glad, Jesus Christ did not have physical children while he was on this earth, despite what hollywood will tell you. Jesus Christ seed is a spiritual seed, all those who believe on him become his sons and the bible tells us here that his seed if they disobey his commandments what does it says he is going to do look at verse 31 “If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;” they are going to lose their salvation, they’re gonna go to hell, I’m not gonna love them anymore, is that what it says? He says “I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips” God’s not going to break his promise, God’s not gonna break his covenant, God’s not going to change what he said, he is not going to alter the thing which came out of his lips. He will punish us but he will not stop loving us and he will not send us to hell and a lot of people think well if you can’t lose your salvation and flip over if you will to Hebrews 6, people will say this if you can’t lose your salvation you might as well go out and live a wicked life and they say what are you saying are you? Are you saying there is just no consequences you can go out and live a wicked life? Just do whatever you want? Just do whatever? But hold on a second what about this life? So to sit there and say I’m saved I can just go out and do whatever I want and I am still going to heaven. Yeah true but you are gonna be destroyed in this life. Now is anyone just okay with that? Is there anyone here that would say I am okay with just living a horrible miserable life and losing everything and being severely punished by God, everytime I turn around being cursed and everything I do as long as I make it to heaven I am okay with that. No because we also want to be blessed in this life, don’t we, I mean do you what God to curse you and punish you and be, that be like if my children said oh wait a minute so you mean to tell me no matter how much I misbehave mom and dad you’re still gonna be my parents and you’re still gonna feed me and I still get to sleep in my bed at night, oh cool I am just gonna go out and just break every rule, I am never gonna obey you. You know what’s going to happen they're gonna get spanked and they’re gonna get spanked and they’re gonna get spanked and they’re gonna be miserable and they are never gonna get to do anything fun. They’re gonna miss out on all the fun things and they’re just gonna keep getting punished and you know what that’s how it is in your life if you disregard God’s word after you’re saved. \r\n\r\nNow if you are not saved you might be able to have a good time and get away with it but you’ll be in hell in the end which is worse but if you are saved, you can’t get away with sin, if you are saved, he doesn’t chase most of his children, he scourges every son whom he receiveth. So if you're not saved children, listen to me young people, you say well you know what I’m saved, I’m going to heaven I am just gonna forget God’s commandments, you will be destroyed, God can destroy your life any time he wants to, God can cause you to be fired from your job anytime he wants to, God can infect you with disease anytime, it is what he said he would do. If you go back to Deuteronomy 27-28 when he goes through all the blessings and curses. He says look I’ll curse you when you go out and I’ll curse you when you're on your way home and I’ll curse your job, I’ll curse your wife, I’ll curse your children, I’ll curse everything that you d. You will fail, you will be filled with disease, you’ll lose your money look God will punish his children no question about that, if we just completely disregard his word. So there are plenty of reasons to obey God’s commandments even tho escaping hell is not one of them. Plenty of reasons to obey God’s commandments, we want God, first of all we just love him, if we love God lets keep his commandments, we should keep his commandments because we want to, not because we are being forced to number one. Number two we what God to bless us. Number three we don’t want God to punish us. Number four we love our fellow man and we know we are going to get more people saved if we live for God then if we live for the world cause we love others and we want to get them saved. \r\n\r\nWhere did I have you turn? Hebrews six okay, so I, I’ve already show you you know a huge amont of scripture that you can’t lose your salvation and you know several points all different which ways so now lets go into, in the short time we have left, let’s go to some passages that people will try to use to say you can lose your salvation and I’m starting with the most common one, now ironically the number one scripture that people show me to show me that you can lose your salvation is matthew seven which was the first verse I showed you in my sermon this morning to show you that you can’t lose it. Where it says I never knew you but I have literally in my time soul winning and preaching have had more people show me matthew seven 21 through 23 to they and show me you can lose your salvation then any other verse in the bible. See right here you can’t just say Lord, Lord you gotta, it’s like you know hello it says right there I never knew you and this is your proof text that you can lose it? But that shows you those who believe not those who are not saved the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believ not and the fact that someone can actually show you Matthew seven as a proof that you can lose your salvation just shows you that they are spiritually blinded, that should just show you right there that they are not saved, they can’t even see the meaning of the simple words, I never knew you. Okay so I am not even gonna turn back to that one, we already talked about that one. The second most common verse people take me to is Hebrews six and those of you who have been soul winning a long time, you will probley agree that these are the top verses that people take you to. Hebrews 6 lets look at this verse four it says “For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak” So lets say a few things about this passage, first of all number one if this verse were teahing that you can lose your salvation, which its not but if it were isn’t it pretty clear that its saying you’d never be able to get it back because it says in verse six “If they shall fall away,” it says it is impossible in verse four, if they shall fall away in verse six “to renew them again unto repentance; “ So if this verse were theoretically teaching you, you can lose your salvation wouldn’t it be saying you can never get it back, but yet everyone you talk to that thinks you can lose it, thinks you can get it back and its like now I’m saved, now I’m not, now I’m saved, now I’m not and they go back and forth. But heres the thing about this passage where does this passage say that these people are saved? or that they had everlasting life? It doesn’t, and that’s the thing when we show verses to prove that you can’t lose your salvation, they use words like saved, they use words like eternal life, they use words like everlasting life, they are clear scriptures. This verse does not say saved, it does not say eternal life, here is what it actually says “those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; “ Now what is this talking about ? This is not talking about a person who gets saved, this is talking about a person who hears the gospel, the holy spirit is working in their hearts, they finally understand it, what does it mean to be enlightened? Dinge the light bulb comes on, I get it now, I understand it, I comprehend it and it fully hits home with them and they have been enlightened, they've tasted it, they’re right there,where this is it, I understand it, the holy ghost is working, they’ve tasted it and they just no, it’s their final rejection. You know its funny when my wife got saved I, and she got saved before she was my wife, you know you should never marry someone that is not saved, this is before that when I first meet her, I meet her out soul winning first thing I did was give her the gospel, you know that’s how me and my wife actually met but I gave my wife the gospel about 20 times before she got saved, it took about 20 times of her hearing the gospel, she was a hard case you know I had to keep giving her the gospel, keep giving her the gospel and it took like about 20 times before my wife finally got saved but she will tell you this if you ask her she will say you know I never fully really understood it until I got saved. She said even tho you kept telling it and explaining it to me it just, I just never, it never quite clicked me, I just never quite understand it and the bible talks a lot about people hearing the word and understanding it not. They don’t get it, so I kept explaining it and explaining it but it is hard for the unsaved person to understand, in fact it’s gotta be threw the holy spirit that they even understand cause the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, it takes the Holy Spirit to even illuminate someone and enlighten someone and the Holy Spirit illuminates and enlightens someone and they get it and then they reject it, a lot of times that’s their last chance. That’s what the bible is teaching here because what is the key word here in this passage? It’s the word in verse eight “But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected,and is nigh unto cursing;” whats a synonym for rejected? Reprobate. Those that are reprobate, now look isn’t the bible here in Hebrews six talking about someone for whom it is impossible to get saved. This is talking about a guy, its impossible to renew this guy into repentance, this guy is not getting saved, this guy is going to be burned, this guy is rejected. These are like the people in Romans one , that God turned over to a reprobate mind, this is like pharaoh whose heart was hardened okay. But the disagreement that I have with people who would use this to say you can lose your salvation is their saying these people got saved and lost it, this passage doesn’t say they got saved, this passage doesn’t say they had everlasting life, It just says they tasted it and they partook of the Holy Ghost. Look the Holy Ghost spoke threw Caiaphas the high priest, who wasn’t even saved, the Holy Ghost came upon Caiaphas in the book of John and he spake as he was moved by the Holy Ghost and he was not even saved, denying belief on Christ, so the fact the Holy Ghost is working in someone does not mean that they are saved, just because they tasted it they’re that close and then they fall away from it. I have seen this, I’ve known people who were on the fence about getting saved, you know they're open to it, they’re coming to church, they’re thinking about it but they’re not saved but they’re thinking about it, the seeds being watered, the seeds been planted its being watered, and they they come to a point where its like no and they walk away from it and then those people become reprobate. They just, its like you can never get that person saved and I can name for you people specifically that I’ve known like that where I’ve seen this in, in my own life okay. So that’s Hebrews six. \r\n\r\nWe already seen matthew seven, lets go to Matthew 24, Matthew chapter 24, I’m just trying to go to the top scriptures that people will try to use to, to say that you can lose your salvation. Matthew seven is the number one, I don’t even know what to say about that, its so bizarre, it says I never knew you period end of story. Then we go to Hebrews six the second most common and, and what do we see there, there’s no clear statement that those people were ever saved or had eternal life, so therefore they must not of been saved because otherwise it would contradict the whole rest of the bible, so obviously those people were just on the verge of getting saved the Holy Ghost is moving and working in them, they’ve tasted it, it’s right there and they walk away and now they’re reprobates. That’s what Hebrews six is teaching and what’s the moral of Hebrews six, the moral is if you’re not saved and God’s working in you and your hearing the word of God and the power of God’s word is working in you, now is the time to get saved because you never know when it’s gonna be your last chance to get saved, that’s what Hebrews six is teaching. \r\n\r\nNow look at Matthew 24 verse 13, here’s another passage, probably the third most common that I’ve been shown a verse 13 “ But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”. Now they say see right there to be saved you have to endure until the end to be saved. Now if you go to verse 9 or let’s go to verse 22 first look at verse 22 “ And except those days should be shortened, there should no “ what? ” flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.” Now let me ask you this verse 22 are we talking about people going to heaven when we say saved? Were talking about the flesh being saved. Is there a difference between the flesh being saved and the soul being saved? Absolutely because in first Corinthians five it says “To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus” So the flesh and the spirit are two different things and so to sit there and use this passage to teach works salvation, you gotta endure to the end to be saved, when it is talking about your flesh being saved, its not talking about your soul being saved. For example when Peter was drowning, what did he cry out to the Lord? “Lord save me” Is that when he got saved? Like thats when he is going to heaven when he cried out Lord save me. No he is talking about saving me physically from drowning, there’s a physical salvation there and here it flat out spells out “And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. “ What days? The days of the tribulation, go back if you would to verse nine because member the verse in question is verse 13 right? Lets get the verses leading up to verse 13 to get the context it says in verse nine “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you:” so does that sound like somebody’s flesh is in danger? Ya, So do you see how they could be saved from being killed? because it says “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” Endure what? This period when people are being killed for the cause of Christ, where people are being betrayed into the hands of the authorities, where people’s love is waxing cold and people are in danger, it’s a time of great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. That’s the context of Matthew 24, and it says the flesh shall be saved. What does that mean? That means if you survive the famine, pestilences, warfare and beheadings and endure to the end you will be saved, meaning you’ll be rescued outta there via the rapture, that’s what it teaches and that’s why by the way people believe in this phoney pre-trib rapture. \r\n\r\nIt can lead you into other false doctrine like this right here cause people who are pre-trib don’t understand this verse and that’s why the biggest independant Baptist Church in Arizona and I will preach against this church by name because they don’t even, there not even King James only and in their statement of faith it says “If you don’t endure to the end you shall not be saved” Thats what it says Tri-city Baptist in Chandler look it up on the internet. Tri-city Baptist aah I can’t believe you’d criticize another church. Hey if they are going to preach lies and heresy and false doctrine, if they’re gonna put a niv in the hand of their teenagers and in their main service they’ll use the King James to please the old people, there trying to please the old people, and please the elderly with the King James and in there teenages youth department where all the girls are in short shorts on their website and they’re giving them all an niv and given them false bibles , esv, new american standard, rock and roll. Hey that is not the future of an independant baptist church, that’s the future of a church one day its gonna be completely off the deep end new evangelical. I mean look those old people are going to be gonna go be with the Lord someday. If were given all the young people a different version, were not even given the young people the King James, were not giving the young people the old hymns of the faith, were not giving the young people the standard of dress, where you dress like a lady and dress like a man and dress modestly look you're destroying the future and that church, that, that fraud tri-city baptist in their statement of faith go look it up it says you have to endure till the end to be saved under the salvation. Look it up just go on there and type endure, you know the little find, in there big long statement of faith, oh you know its only those who endure to the end that are truly saved. Your teaching works, is what you're doing. Oh but they say its by faith, ya but they say if you endure until the end you weren’t saved. \r\n\r\nSee this calvinist, look I am against calvinism and calvinism is a fraud where you just never really were saved if you fall away, you know, well when the armenian says you can lose it and the calvinist says you never really were saved in the first place and the bible believing baptist says you know what you might get out of church but your still saved, you might quite on God but he’s not gonna quit on you, the eternal security of the believer, once saved always saved and they’re gonna take this Matthew 24 a tribulation passage and turn all that on its head, which is a sentence taken out of context. You take it out of context right, he that endureth till the end shall be saved, I mean it almost, it sounds like that right. I mean what if we just took that all by itself, let’s be honest doesn’t that sound like it says you have to endure till the end to be saved, thats what it says right? But thats why you have to read the bible in context and thats why anybody who takes this verse by itself and quotes it by itself is a liar. Anybody who quotes well you have to endure till the end to be saved, thats how you’re going to get to heaven is a liar, that is not what this says. This says your flesh will be saved, this says they're trying to kill you and you gotta endure that persecution. \r\n\r\nGo to Matthew ten, well find the same thing Matthew chapter ten. Same exact thing another passage people will bring out to say you can lose your salvation. You say why are you so fired up? Why are you so upset? Because even baptists are deceived today, you know we, we need to stand strong on this. Look I know we, I know that everybody here already believes you can’t lose your salvation. I are at least ninety-nine percent, I already know we believe this but you know what its not enough to just to know something, we need to know what we know it and we need to know why we know it and we need to know how to prove it from scripture because I want these foundations of doctrines to be strongly laid for the next generation and that everyone will not just walk out of here saying I know that we can’t lose our salvation but to say I got ten reasons why we can’t lose it biblically and I’m ready when they try to pull this fraudulent. I you know he that endure till the end shall be saved and whip that out of context and throw that at me, ya I know how to answer it, I know what the truth is, we need to know the truth. \r\n\r\nThe bible says in Matthew chapter 10, the same thing ah let me find it verse 21 “And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death,” so what are we talking about? Were talking about someone being physical killed, saved people being killed for their faith. “ and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.” Why because the children don’t believe the same things that the parents believe, I wonder if its because they are reading out of a different bible? I wonder if its because they have a completely different music? I wonder if it is because they have a completely different doctrine, different lifestyle, different training, different schooling, different everything. He said “the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.” So again what are we talking about? The Second coming of Jesus Christ. Is that not what its talking about in verse 23? Second coming of Christ, so in verse 21 people are being killed for the cause of Christ and in verse 22 were being hated and if we endure till the end will be saved, by what? The coming of Christ, he said just flee into another city, they’re killing you, the heads are coming off, flee into another city and you know eventually if you can endure until the end you’ll be saved, you’ll be delivered. That’s why, ya know and I can go on and on, you know there are so many scriptures on that subject of Matthew 10 and Matthew 24, we can go on and on. \r\n\r\nI mean he keeps going look at verse 28 “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul:” Do you see how there is a distinction being made? Between the body being saved and the soul being saved? The body being killed, the soul being killed? “ fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. “ We can go on and on, I’ve got a few other scriptures that people will go to second Timothy Chapter 2 it just proves that you’re own security even more when you actually turn to it. I don’t have any time but folks we can’t lose our salvation and that’s the best news you’ve heard all day because if you could lose your salvation we’d all lose it . We’d lose it this week, you know I mean, no, none of us could, would be able to live up to the standard of earning our way into heaven. Thank God that our sins are gone as far as the east is from the west God has separated us from our sins and thank God for that promise he has promised us, the earnest of the spirit and we got his word that promises us hundreds of times that we can never lose our salvation. Don’t let the false teachers spin you on this and be read to give an answer and when you by the way when you go out soul winning don’t ever give the gospel to anyone without teaching them about eternal security before you pray with them, before you pray and have them call upon the name of the Lord make sure they even understand what the gospel is, what the good news is that salvation is free and it is eternal. \r\n\r\nNow lets bow our heads and have a word of prayer. Father we thank you so much for your word and we thank you for the truths of your word. Please Lord just help us all to preach this message to as many people as we can, people are not saved their lost and many people are even claiming the name of Jesus and they think their wonderful works are going to save them. Lord help us to preach this message of once saved always saved, of faith alone for salvation and that it is not of works. Help us to scream this from the housetops, help us to stand against the churches that call themselves baptists and preach all this false works based calvinistic, repent of your sins and jump through hoops to be saved. Lord help us to stand against it, to fight the good fight, to earnestly contend for the faith and to just proclaim door to door and to our friends, family and loved ones that salvation is the free gift through Christ, we love you and thank you and in Jesus name we pray Amen \r\n\r\nAlright lets sing one more song before we go, how bout 227. Alright we broke the record again, what's the number? oh wow its best when we only break it by one. That means we will break it again sooner hahaha. you know and you know what it's exciting because we are living in a day when a lot of independent baptist churches are getting smaller, shrinking but you know what we need to keep growing and thriving and you know if we keep preaching the truth and knocking doors, you know there’s no reason why we have to get smaller, it can only get bigger and so thank you everyone for being here today and helping out, ok lets sing 220.

379	The Truth about Birth Control-Documentary	Pastor Anderson	2015-01-01 02:00:00	20141231P_TheTruthAboutBirthControl-Documentary.mp3	EMRFAhfCX10	https://soundcloud.com/bible-preaching/the-truth-about-birth-control	f	Faithful Word Baptist Church	Introduction - Did you know that birth control pills actually cause early silent abortions? Dominique Davis: Most people think that birth control pills simply prevent a woman from getting pregnant which is sometimes the case however, birth control pills also act as an abortifacient, snuffing out a young life that has already begun. Not only that but the bible actually condemns other birth control methods as well. In our modern society, birth control is something that most people take for granted and have never even questioned but we as Christians have been commanded by the bible to prove all things and in the course of this film, you will learn the shocking truth about birth control. \r\n\r\nDr. Marie Anderson: “Currently in the United States the pill is used by over 11 million women many of whom are unaware of its mechanisms of action even though they are printed on the packaging. Our message today is that the pill kills babies with its abortifacient affects” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: Birth control pills cause silent abortions. If you are taking birth control pills, you are inadvertently, literally killing your children and remember this is the most commonly used birth control method. So before we get into the subject from the bible of whether birth control is right or wrong, let me just start by saying that the most commonly used, the most popular method of birth control, the one that four out of five women have used is a pill that will literally cause your unborn children to die. Let me start out by proving to you, from the bible, that life begins at conception. Look down at your bible at Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: Now flip over if you would to Matthew chapter 1 because in Matthew chapter 1 this exact scripture is quoted in the New Testament. In the Old Testament it said “a virgin shall conceive and bare a son” while in Matthew chapter 1 verse 23 the bible reads: \r\n\r\nDominque Davis: “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: So isn’t it interesting that in the Old Testament it says conceived and in the New Testament it says she’ll be with child. You know what that tells me? That conception produces a child. Not a blastocyst or an embryo or a fetus but God considers that a child. When we talk about life beginning at conception the devil loves to change the meaning of words. Now conception has historically always meant fertilization when the seed from the man and the eggs from the woman come together and that egg is fertilized. That has been known as conception but now they’re starting to change the definition and even in some dictionaries they’ll put a definition that says “well its fertilization or implantation”. \r\n\r\nDominque Davis: Dr. Vanesse Cullins, Vice President for medical affairs at Planned Parenthood Federation of America was asked if hormonal birth control pills cause abortion. Her response was “No. Abortion ends a pregnancy. Contraception pills work before a pregnancy begins. Pregnancy begins with the implantation of the developing fertilized egg in a woman’s uterus” yet in the next paragraph she admits “implantation doesn’t occur until five to seven days after fertilization”. \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: Let’s see what the bible defines as conception, let’s make the bible our final authority. The bible says in Hebrews 11 verse 11 \r\n\r\nDominque Davis: “Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: So let me ask you this, could conceive seed refer to implantation? Let me explain to you the terms here, the seed of the man travels into the woman’s body and finds the egg and the egg is fertilized up toward the top of the fallopian tubes. That fertilized egg, that developing child that’s multiplying and growing and so forth is traveling down that tube until it gets to the uterus and when it arrives at the uterus it implants itself into the wall of the uterus and then eventually that’s where the placenta is going to be attached and then there’s going to be a cord and the baby and so on and so forth. But that developing life comes down that tube and implants in the wall of the uterus. Now when the bible says that she receives strength to conceive seed notice that conception is tied in with the seed isn’t it? Is the seed involved with implantation? No, because the seed is long gone. The seed from the man fertilizes that egg and then all the seed is gone. Okay and then a week goes by and then it implants. How could you call implantation ‘conceiving seed’? You can’t, there’s no seed there anymore, the seed has been gone for over a week. So we see that the worlds definition, that’s a new definition that they’re twisting and changing things to meanand that planned parenthood has pushed, is not in tune with the bible. It’s just a lie of the devil to try to get you to say ‘oh yea life begins at conception, that’s 7 to 14 days after fertilization’. So here’s how these birth control pills work, the combination pill works according to two mechanisms. There’s a primary mechanism and then there’s a backup mechanism. The primary mechanism is to stop a woman from ovulating, she does not release an egg therefore no pregnancy can occur now. If a woman just doesn’t release an egg and no pregnancy occurs is any human life being snuffed out, is anyone being killed? No, it’s just no egg is produced and so there’s not a pregnancy but there’s the backup mechanism. \r\n\r\nDr. Marie Anderson: “The pill thins the uterine lining and depletes it of essential nutrients such as Glycodelin-A to the degree that it cannot nourish a newly conceived baby. IVF data has repeatedly shown that the minimal endometrial thickness which is required to maintain an early pregnancy ranges from 5 to 13 millimeters. The average endometrial thickness of a pill user is only 1.4 millimeters. This is simply too thin to nourish a baby. Consequently the baby dies and this is an abortion.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: You say ‘well how often is this happening’, well it depends on what type of pill is being taken. The most common pill, the popular pill, is the combination pill which is estrogen and progestin combination. Breakthrough ovulation, which is when an egg is released even though you’re taking the birth control pill, occurs five to sixty percent of the time. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: Simple logic tells us that if an egg can be released and fertilized 5 to 60 percent of the time and implantation is being prevented close to 100 percent of the time, a silent abortion is taking place 5 to 60 percent of months that a woman is taking the pill because the 7 day old child is unable to implant and dies. The morning after pill functions after the same principle to destroy the lining of the uterus but in a shorter period of time due to higher concentrations of the same hormones. \r\n\r\nDr. Marie Anderson: “Women deserve to be told the truth about the abortifacient mechanisms of the pill. To deemphasize this information is unconscionable” Steven Anderson: Same thing with the Depo-Provera patch, the Depo-Provera shots: any hormonal birth control method is an abortifacient that is causing you to have a silent abortion some percentage of the time and we as Christians should just reject it outright as being manslaughter or murder to take these types of pills knowing what they’re doing to your body and knowing what they’re doing to your children. \r\n\r\nDominque Davis: The term birth control pills is accurate since they do not prevent conception but birth. Perhaps the reason God has not entered the abortion holocaust in America is that God’s own people are unknowingly murdering their own offspring. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: (Proverbs 24:11-12) “If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: And not only that, I’m doing you a great favor by warning you about these things because honestly birth control pills are very harmful to your health in the first place. \r\n\r\nDr. Angela Lanfranchi: “You know the pill kills and I’m gonna tell you during this talk how that happens. There are four major mechanisms how the pill can kill. They cause your blood to clot, they cause cancer, they make it easier to get potentially lethal infections and they make it more likely you will die a violent death. So what about this blood clotting? Well, if the blood clots in a artery of your heart it’s a heart attack or an MI, if it clots in your brain that’s called a stroke, if it causes clots in the veins in your legs that’s called a DVT or a deep venous thrombosis and if those clots in your legs break off and go to your lung that’s called a pulmonary embolism. In 2005, the international agency on research of cancer which is part of the World Health Organization, a U.N. body, put out monograph 91 that stated estrogen-progestin combination drugs in hormone replacement therapy in birth control pills were group 1 carcinogens for breast, cervical and liver cancer. And yet that didn’t make it on the 6 o’clock news. 2006 Chris Kahlenborn published a meta-analysis on the pill in the Mayo Clinic Proceeding Journal. In 2009, Dolle and other authors put out this paper that showed that you had a 320% increased risk of triple negative breast cancer. Triple negative breast cancer is the hardest breast cancer to treat because it’s not sensitive to hormonal treatment, it’s not sensitive to that monoclonal antibody drug Herceptin and there are a lot of deaths from it in premenopausal women especially. So if you took the pill 18 and under and that’s very common I have patients that come in, they’re 22, and they’ve already been on it for ten years cause they got put on it when they were 12 and they had painful periods. So since 1975 by the governmental seer data that you can also look up on the web, the incidents of insight to breast cancers non-invasive breast cancers has gone up 400 percent in premenopausal women. So you also increase the risk of cervical cancer and you also increase the risk of liver cancer.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: If you look at the history of birth control in this country first of all historically it’s been considered ungodly and immoral to use birth control by Christian people throughout history in fact it was illegal in the United States until the 20th century. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: Before 1936, all contraceptive devices and birth control methods were illegal in the United States of America. In 1938, Judge August Hand lifted the federal ban on birth control. In 1965, the United States Supreme Court overturned one of the last state laws prohibiting the prescription or use of contraceptives by married couples. What the world in the civil government considered immoral and even criminal fundamental Christianity embraces less than seventy years later. \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: Preachers used to be against birth control. You know one of the most famous Baptist preachers of all times names is John R Rice and whether you love John R Rice or you’re not a fan of John R Rice isn’t really the point, he was a mainstream, very popular independent Baptist preacher. John R Rice said this in 1946: \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “Birth control measures, if generally practiced, would be disastrous to public morals and public welfare.” Steven Anderson: Here’s what else he said: \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “The use of artificial means, drugs and appliances to prevent conception has for centuries been regarded as immoral, wrong for the individual, and dangerous to society as a whole.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: Yet people today will act like “aw you know, what are you preaching? You’re an independent Baptist and you’re preaching against birth control? You’re wild, you’re crazy you fanatic” But this is what everyone used to believe. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: In the words of our 26th president Theodore Roosevelt “Birth control is sinful”. Could a Baptist preacher today say in his pulpit what the president of the United States said in a public speech only one hundred years ago? \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: The woman who is responsible for bringing birth control into the mainstream and making it legal in the United States was a woman named Margaret Sanger. Now this Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist \r\n\r\nSo where did this campaign for birth control as a means of ‘better health’ and empowering the family for the black community originate? We have to understand something called eugenics which was basically people’s thoughts that the unfit should not reproduce and the fit should. So from this background of eugenics someone named Margaret Sanger and if you’re not familiar with her she’s the founder of Planned Parenthood. Margaret Sanger was a proponent of eugenics and she believed that the racially unfit should not reproduce and during her time in the early 1900s who would be the racially unfit? Well, they’d be African Americans. \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: She believed that white people were superior to other races and she would, like the Nazis you know believed that certain races were inferior to others and that we need to encourage those people not to reproduce so that we can just have good people reproduce and the fittest and the strongest people reproduce. \r\n\r\nSo in comes Margaret Sanger with her slick talk but in reality Margaret Sanger thought of these people as human waste which really they should not be reproducing anymore because they’re just like weeds and so she came in with her talk of family planning and better health to try to basically trick the community into buying her program which is really sterilization, birth control and abortion. \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: She started an organization called the Birth Control Federation of America and you know what the Birth Control Federation of America later changed its name to? Planned parenthood which I call planned baronhood. Planned Parenthood, that wicked organization that conservatives rail against for being pro-abortion and pro-death was actually originally known as the birth control federation of America. So you can see the type of evil people that are behind this agenda. She’s the one who pushed this through and got it legal in the United States. She’s the one that promoted it and made it mainstream. This wicked, evil person named Margaret Sanger who was an evolutionist and not a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ by any stretch of the imagination. Cut Scene – “This is Margaret Slee, President of America’s Planned Parenthood Federation maintains that European women should stop having babies for the next ten years. \r\n\r\nQuestion to Margaret – “Don’t you think such a theory, such a radical theory is anti-social?” Response – “On the contrary, it seems to me that it is more practical and humane but from my view I believe there should be no more babies” Another question to Margaret – “Do you believe in sin? When I say believe I don’t mean believe in committing sin do you believe there is such a thing as sin?” \r\n\r\nResponse – “I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically. Delinquents, prisoners all sorts of things just marked when they’re born: that to me is the greatest sin that people can commit.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: The bottom line is that biblically speaking, God wants us to have children and he wants us to be fruitful and multiply. Let’s look at some scriptures on this. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: (Genesis 1:28) “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: And you say well Pastor Anderson, God’s just telling them to be fruitful and multiply because there is only two of them. Obviously when there are only two people you have to be fruitful and multiply but what you have to understand is that he used the word replenish for a reason. Now if he were just talking to Adam and Eve only the word replenish would make absolutely no sense because replenish means to refill. Well guess what it had never been filled before so how could he tell them to refill or replenish. The reason he tells them to replenish is because of the fact that it’s not a command just to Adam and Eve but rather a command to all of mankind to continually replenish the earth. Children are gonna be born and people are going to die and it’s our job to be fruitful and to multiply and to replenish the earth on an on-going basis and the word replenish proves that he was not speaking to just Adam only in that scripture. But even so we have tons of other scripture, look at Genesis chapter nine what God said to Noah. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” Genesis 9:1 \r\n\r\n“And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.” Genesis 9:7 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: You say Pastor Anderson there’s only eight of them of course they need to replenish. I’m gonna show you that this is a theme that comes up over and over again. This wasn’t just Adam, this wasn’t just Noah. Over and over again God’s people are told to be fruitful and multiply. It says in chapter 17 verse 20. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.” Genesis 17:20 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: And by the way notice that being fruitful and multiplying is always associated with blessing, being bless. When you’re fruitful, when you multiply that’s a blessing in the bible. Genesis 28 verse 3. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;” “And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;” Genesis 35:11 \r\n\r\n“And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.” Genesis 48:4 \r\n\r\n“For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.” Leviticus 26:9 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: This is when the children of Israel are already numbering in the millions. There are millions and millions of the children of Israel and they’re out of Egypt and they’re going into the promise land and God says if you obey my voice and if you keep my commandments I will make you fruitful and I will multiply you. God wants his people to be fruitful and to multiply and it’s a blessing when they do. Now in Exodus chapter one we have a story about the children of Israel, they’ve gone down into Egypt and when they went down into Egypt the bible tells us in verse five. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.” Exodus 1:5-6 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: So, the children of Israel that go down into Egypt are seventy souls, seventy people and they’re going down to Egypt which is one of the most powerful nations in the world a great big giant powerful nation, they are seventy people. Let’s fast forward a few hundred years and look what the bible says in verse seven. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.” Exodus 1:7 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: Let me ask you this, are God’s people multiplying? And look what the bible says in verse 8. \r\n\r\nDominque Davis: “Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:” Exodus 1:8-9 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: So are the Egyptians multiplying at the same rate as the Israelites? No, the Egyptians are obviously not multiplying and by the way, if you go to Planned Parenthood’s website they’ll tell you birth control was invented in Ancient Egypt. That’s what Planned Parenthood says on their website. The oldest known birth control we’ve found was found in Ancient Egypt and the bible here shows us a contrast of God’s people being fruitful, multiplying and increasing abundantly while the population of the worldly Egyptians is not keeping pace at all to the point where seventy people outpace them. And they say the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we. Now look Pharaoh here, this evil king that wants to kill children later in the chapter represents the devil and so what we see in this story is that number one God’s people multiplied greatly, number two we see the devil didn’t like it, the devil is upset about it. So what’s the devil gonna do about it to stop it, let’s read it. It says in verse ten. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.” Exodus 1:10 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: They said look we need to do something about this, we need to stop these people from multiplying. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.” Exodus 1:11-13 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: And what do we see here in all these verses over and over again they’re making him do what work and serve with rigor and have burdens and have to do all this hard work and be in bondage. But even in spite of all that they keep multiplying and growing don’t they? So look what the next step is, it says in verse number 15. \r\n\r\nDominque Davis: “And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.” Exodus 1:15-17 \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: So what do we see here in this story? Number one God’s people are multiplying greatly, number two the devil doesn’t like it, number three he afflicts them with burdens, hard work, servitude and makes their lives rigorous and difficult and then number four he instructs the Hebrews to murder their children. But you know what the devil has done to try to stop God’s people from multiplying is he says you know what let’s put them to work and notably he wants to put the women to work. Put the women to work, that’ll stop them from multiplying because what was the devils answer in Exodus one he said put them to work and then kill the ones that are conceived and that’s exactly what the devils agenda is today he says number one send the women to work and then they won’t be able to reproduce because they’re not gonna be able to miss work, they’re not gonna be able to take care of the kids so they’re gonna be so busy with their job they’re gonna be forced to use birth control and then not only that but the ones they would conceive we will slay them through what birth control pills that do cause silent early abortions and also through abortion itself surgical abortion itself. Now the United States Department of Labor has these statistics for 2013 that women participating in the labor force in 2013 that are of a working age, is 57.2 percent and men working is 69.7 percent. It’s not even that different I mean think about it, it’s only about what a twelve percent difference between the men working versus the women working. It didn’t used to be that way folks. It used to be that men went out to work and the women stayed home. That was the norm that was the accepted societal norm that men would go to work and provide and that the women would stay home, marry, bear children and guide the house. I think I read that in the bible first Timothy chapter five verse fourteen. \r\n\r\nDominque Davis: (1 Timothy 5:14-15) “I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. For some are already turned aside after Satan.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: I will, God’s will, I will therefore that women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully for some are already turned aside after Satan. That’s what the bible says. But this story that we see playing out in Exodus chapter one is the devils modus operandi in 2014 as well, same thing. Put the women to work and then slay the unborn that’s the plan you say okay pastor Anderson you’ve at least convinced me that the birth control pills are wrong because they are taking a life I mean how can you be against the morning after pill and not against normal birth control pills when the morning after pill is just a high-dose birth control pill that’s all it is. The morning after pill contains the same hormones at a higher dose that will just quickly change the lining of the uterus to make it a hostile environment for the child, that’s why it works. But you say well pastor Anderson okay I’m convinced that uh you know birth control pills are the wrong way to go, they’re abortifacients but what about other birth control methods I mean come on are you telling me that birth control’s just wrong and that there’s no acceptable birth control method, in a word yes. But let’s just go through the methods quickly and I don’t wanna you know I’m not gonna get into any detail or be graphic or anything but there are a few different types of methods go to Genesis chapter thirty eight, if you would, Genesis chapter thirty eight because Genesis thirty eight is the only mention of birth control in the entire bible, it says in verse 8. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. And the thing which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also.” (Genesis 38:8-10) \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: God got angry and killed him. Not a very good advertisement for birth control right here in Genesis 38, it’s not looking good and especially when you realize this is the only mention of birth control. You say oh ho pastor Anderson you poor ignorant fool don’t you realize that the reason God was mad at Onan was the reason why he spilled it on the ground why what was wrong with his reason. You say well its cause he did it for a selfish reason yeah but everybody who uses birth control is doing it for a selfish reason. Name for me a birth control motivation that’s not selfish. Dominique Davis: Why do today’s Christians seek to limit the size of their families by means of birth control? Not one reason can be given as to why a Christian would want to bypass the blessing of children that is not motivated by either selfishness or a lack of faith in God. The bible clearly teaches that it is the LORD that opens the womb of a woman and causes her to conceive a child. Who are we to tamper with the will of God? \r\n\r\n(Genesis 20:18) “For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.” \r\n\r\n(Genesis 29:31) “And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.” \r\n\r\n(Genesis 30:22) “And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.” \r\n\r\n(1 Samuel 1:5-6) “But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb. And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb.” \r\n\r\n(Isaiah 66:9) “Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.” Steven Anderson: You say okay well what other methods are there, there’s gotta be an acceptable method out there of birth control. Well, these are the basic classifications of birth control methods. First of all you have hormonal birth control and that’s gonna include your IUDs that release hormones these Mirena ring things and the patch and the shot and the mini pill and the combination pill. All hormonal birth control methods we’ll put those in the same category and those should be immediately ruled out for being manslaughter or if you do it intentionally on purpose it would be murder if you do it by accident it’s manslaughter okay? Those are ruled out then another method that people would use is the Onan method we’ll call it, you know spilling it on the ground. You know the bible isn’t really saying anything positive about that method. Then another method people would use is a barrier method is what they’ll call it and to me a barrier method is pretty much the same thing as Onan’s method, you know, I’ll put it in the same category personally okay and then another method that’s pretty popular amongst Catholics and this is what the Catholics teach that you should be doing is called natural family planning or NFP. Now natural family planning you know you’re not really using birth control per se because you’re not using barriers, you’re not using the pills or anything like that. I’m just gonna say it right now I’m against natural family planning I don’t believe in it, my children are approximately two years apart and we do not use any birth control we use none, zero, zilch okay. The only birth control method we use is getting on our knees and praying for God to give us more children that’s our only birth control that we use okay but we never use any so how and I’ll explain to you a little later how our children are two years apart and we do not use natural family planning, NFP, this is also sometimes known as the rhythm method, we do not use it and I’m repeating this because people often mistakenly think oh pastor Anderson believes in natural family planning or pastor Anderson is you know believes in the rhythm method, no I don’t, I’ve never taught that, never believed that. We don’t use it none of our children are spaced through natural family planning. Natural family planning is where you chart out a woman’s cycle and they chart out her monthly cycle and sometimes they’ll use computer software, smartphone app, different charts maybe even take your temperature and chart all this data and enter it into a computer and this software will tell you when you are the most fertile each month. So there’s about five to seven days a month that are blacked out as okay this is the time she’s most likely to get pregnant so if you abstain during these five to seven months she’s probably not going to get pregnant. That’s called natural family planning or the rhythm method. Now a lot of Catholics will use this and that’s what the Catholic Church promotes and they’ll say this they’ll say well God could still make you get pregnant if he wanted to so it’s not really birth control you know this is kinda like well you know it could still be but here’s why I’m against natural family planning, because of the fact that first of all there’s another big blackout period each month if you know what I mean so now we have two major blackouts each month number one okay but number two the fact is that during the blackout period is actually the best time for a husband and his wife to hit the sack because that’s actually when a woman is going to enjoy it the most. I’m not trying to- I’m keeping this G rated but it’s just a scientific fact that women actually desire intimacy the most during that period why because when their body is ovulating and when they are releasing that egg and able to become pregnant they naturally desire that union with their husband so it’s, isn’t it kinda foolish to blackout the best part of the month for intimacy between husband and wife and say well okay the best time for doing it, the best week, we’re not gonna do it that week. That’s not very good for your marriage okay especially because now you have these two big blackout periods each month so half the month is x’d off the calendar okay but not only that look what the bible says in first Corinthians chapter seven. Defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that you may use natural family planning is that what it says? It says except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. What is the purpose of God saying hey do not abstain from a physical relationship with your spouse, do not defraud one the other he said because you don’t want Satan to tempt you for your incontinency. And the blackout period of natural family planning is the time when the husband and wife would be the most open to temptation so and God’s not even making any allowance for it here. He’s not teaching us hey abstain every month in order not to have children no children are a blessing, you’re supposed to be fruitful and multiply, we’re supposed to be having lots of children according to the bible. Psalm one twenty seven says this \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: (Psalm 127:3-5) “Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: God says children are a blessing we should wanna have our quiver full of them, it’s a joy and a blessing and a good thing to have children so when you teach and you say hey be fruitful, multiply, increase abundantly, exceedingly, have children, don’t use birth control you don’t need to be Onan and you don’t need to murder your own children, you don’t need to sit there and abstain from a physical relationship from your spouse during the best parts of the month no the bible is telling us to have children. People will say this that well if you do that you’re going to get pregnant every nine months and that’s not healthy. That’s what they’ll say won’t they have you heard this opposition? Now personally I don’t think that that’s healthy for women to have children every nine or ten months and frankly that’s why God didn’t design it that way. And that’s why even though my wife and I use no birth control we do not have children every nine or ten months. You say pastor Anderson how do you do it, how are you not having children every eleven, twelve months pastor Anderson what’s the deal, what’s your secret? Hosea chapter one verse eight says this. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: “Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.” \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: When did this woman conceive? When she weaned why? Because breast feeding will stop you from getting pregnant. \r\n\r\nSimply breastfeeding your baby regularly and exclusively can help you prevent another pregnancy for six months. How does it work? Well, if you breastfeed exclusively that means no formula or other baby foods, the hormones in your body will naturally change to prevent ovulation, the release of an egg. No egg, no pregnancy. This all happens naturally without a prescription or any medication. Breastfeeding is safe, simple and convenient. There are no negative side effects, there’s nothing to buy, there are a lot of great health and nutrition benefits for your baby and for you. Breastfeeding is incredibly effective as birth control, so effective that for every 100 women who breastfeed continuously for the first six months after birth, only one or two of them will get pregnant. \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: It is ninety nine percent effective if you do it properly. If you breastfeed on demand your child, that will prevent you from getting pregnant again until it is naturally safe to do so. Look God designed it in his wisdom. Think about how smart God is. God designs it where a woman gives birth to a child and then breastfeeding that child keeps her from getting pregnant again until her body has a chance to recover. And then by the time the child is older and grown and you know able to eat a lot of solids and breastfeeding less and less, then the woman’s fertility will come back and then she’ll be able to have the next child and this is not a birth control method because we were gonna breastfeed the kid anyway. It’s just called doing it normal. It’s called just having your kid and feeding it the way God planned so this isn’t natural family planning that’s why I wanna make sure there’s no confusion here. This is not a birth control method this is not using birth control and yet having children that are spaced normally and naturally and healthy. But this is why it doesn’t work for most people because if you put your kid on a four-hour feeding schedule not gonna work. You must feed the child on demand meaning when it’s hungry feed it and with a newborn that’s pretty much every hour so when my wife has a little baby she’s feeding the baby constantly, she’s nursing it constantly okay that’s one of the rules, number two the baby has to sleep in bed with you because if you don’t have the baby in bed with you then you can’t feed it on demand throughout the night every hour. Now a lot of people will say oh baby in bed with you that’s a bassinet next to the bed no see and this is why it doesn’t always work for people because they don’t follow the protocol that’s gonna work. They try to do a four hour feeding schedule they’re supplementing with bottles, they’re having the baby in a bassinet or crib or something like that, no, the baby has to be in bed with you but society wants you using birth control. I think exodus one shows us why because the devil doesn’t like it when God’s people multiply and while the Mormons are multiplying and while the Muslims are multiplying, God’s people are having 2.5 children and it’s a shame. We as God’s people need to multiply abundantly and churches would be filled with a new generation that’s growing up and learning the word precept upon precept, line upon line and they’re gonna grow up and be a by the army for the Lord but instead people are refusing to have kids cause they’re serving the idols of this world and chasing after materialism or they’re buying into the ideology of the Satan worshiper Margaret Sanger because they’re being brainwashed by TV and school and everything else and I’m here to tell you, today, that God’s way is the best way the natural way the Christian way and if you would get on God’s program by faith and just step out in faith and say hey I’m gonna do it God’s way you know what you’ll find that God will provide and that God will give you a lot of joy and happiness in your life and God’s gonna bless you because the path to God’s blessing is through the door of obedience. \r\n\r\nDominique Davis: The people of God have been heavily influenced by the ungodly world system and the key doctrines of the bible presented here have all but fallen by the wayside. We have gone from condemning all methods of birth control to condoning and even promoting birth control pills which are the most heinous form of birth control. Would to God this generation would stand up and fight for this key doctrine of God’s word and cleanse our churches from the blood of our sons and daughters \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Credits: The bible is really clear on salvation. It is not based on how good you are. A lot of people think that they’re pretty good, and that they are going to get to heaven because they’re pretty good but the Bible says, “For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23) The Bible says, “As it is written there is none righteous, no, not one.” (Romans 3:10) I’m not righteous. You’re not righteous, and if it were our goodness that would get us into heaven, none of us would be going. \r\n\r\nThe bible even says in Revelation 21:8, “But the fearful and unbelieving, the abominable and murderers and sorcerers and whoremongers and idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.” I have lied before. Everyone has lied before, so we have all sinned, and we have done things worse than lying. Let’s face it: we all deserve hell. \r\n\r\nBut the Bible says, “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8) Jesus Christ, because he loves us, came to this earth. The bible says he was God manifest in the flesh. God basically took on human form. He lived a sinless life. He did not commit any sin, and of course, they beat him, and spit on him, and nailed him to the cross. The Bible says that when he was on that cross he “himself bare our sins in his own body on the tree.” (1 Peter 2:24) So every sin you have ever done, and every sin I have ever done - it was as if Jesus had done it. He was being punished for our sins. Then they took his body when he had died, and buried it in the tomb, and his soul went down to Hell for three days and three nights (Acts 2:31). Three days later he rose again from the dead. He showed unto the disciples the holes in his hands. The Bible is really clear that Jesus did die for everybody. It says that he died “not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world” (1 John 2:2). But there is something that we must do to be saved. The bible has that question in Acts 16, “What must I do to be saved? And they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.” That is all. He did NOT say, “Join a church, and you’ll be saved. Get baptized, and you’ll be saved. Live a good life, and you’ll be saved. Repent of all your sins, and you’ll be saved, NO. He said “believe.” \r\n\r\nEven the most famous verse in the whole Bible, whose reference is written on the bottom of the cup at “In and Out Burger.” It’s so famous. Everybody’s heard of it: John 3:16. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.” And everlasting means everlasting. It means forever, and Jesus said, “I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.” (John 10:28) The Bible says in John 6:47, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life.” So if you believe on Jesus Christ, the Bible says you have everlasting life. You are going to live forever. You can’t lose your salvation. It’s eternal, it’s everlasting. Once you’re saved, once you believe on him, you’re saved forever, and no matter what, you can never lose your salvation. \r\n\r\nEven if I were to go out and commit some awful sin, God will punish me for it on this earth. If I went out and killed somebody today, God would make sure that I got punished, I’m going to prison, or far worse, or the death penalty. However this world punishes me, and God is going to make sure I get punished even more, but I’m not going to Hell. There is nothing I can do to go to hell because I’m saved, and if I went to hell, then God lied. Because he promised that whoever believeth has everlasting life, and he said, “Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.” That is why there are a lot of examples of people in the Bible who did some really bad things, yet they made it to Heaven. How? Because they were so good? NO, it’s because they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. Their sins are forgiven. Other people who may have lived a better life in the world’s eyes, or maybe they really even lived a better life, if they don’t believe in Christ, they are going to have to go to hell to be punished for their sins. \r\n\r\nLet me just close on this one thought: one thing that I wanted to be sure and bring up today is that there was a question that was asked to Jesus by one of his disciples, and that question was this: are there few that be saved? That’s a good question, right? Are most people saved? Or is it few that are saved? Who here thinks that most people are going to heaven - that most people in this world are going to heaven? Guess what the answer was: he said, in Matthew 7, “Enter ye in at the strait gate because wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.” (Matthew 7:13-14) Then he went on to say this: “Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity.” (Matthew 7:21-23) \r\n\r\nFirst of all, the majority of this world doesn’t even claim to believe in Jesus. Thankfully the majority of this classroom claims to believe in Jesus, but the majority of the world does not claim to believe in Jesus. But God warned that even amongst those who claim to believe in Jesus, even among those that call him Lord, many will be saying to him, “We did all these wonderful works! Why aren’t we saved!” He is going to say, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” That is because salvation is not by works, and if you are trusting your own works to save you, if you think you’re going to heaven because you’ve been baptized, if you think, “Well, I think you have to live a good life, I think you have to keep the commandments to be saved, I think you have to go to church, I think you have to turn from your sins…” If you are trusting in your works, Jesus is going to say to you one day, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” \r\n\r\nYou must have all your faith in what he did. You must put your faith in what Jesus did on the cross when he died for you, was buried, and rose again. That’s your ticket into heaven. If you’re trusting other things, and you say, “Well, I’m going to heaven because I’m such a good Christian, and I do all these wonderful things.” He is going to say, “Depart from me.” Notice what he said, “Depart from me, I NEVER knew you.” He didn’t say, “I used to know you.” Once he knows you… remember I mentioned this earlier: it’s everlasting its eternal. Once he knows you, you are saved forever. He is going to say, “Depart from me, I never knew you,” because if you go to Hell, it is because he never knew you. Because once he knows you, he knows you. Just as my children will always be my children. When you’re born again, when you’re his child, you’ll always be his child. You may be the black sheep of the family. You may be somebody who gets disciplined by God heavily on this earth. You can screw up your life down here, but you can’t screw up salvation. Once you are saved, it is a done deal. That is the main thing I wanted to present to you about the end times, and we do have just a few minutes for questions about either salvation or about the end times.

The name was quickly changed to the more politically correct term "AIDS" or "Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome." But the fact remains that the AIDS epidemic was originally the result of abominations commited by homosexuals, or what the Bible calls "sodomites". The media has convinced most Americans that homosexuality is a harmless alternative lifestyle, but nothing could be further from the truth, and this film will prove it. \r\n\r\n-Scientists at the National Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta today released the results of a study which shows that the lifestyle of some male homosexuals has triggered an epidemic of a rare form of cancer. \r\n\r\nRobert Bazell now in Atlanta: \r\n\r\n-Bobby Campbell of San Francisco and Billy Walker of New York both suffer from a mysterious newly discovered disease which affects mostly homosexual men. Researchers know of 413 people who have contracted the condition in the past year. One third have died and none have been cured. Investigators have examined the habits of homosexuals for clues. \r\n\r\n-San Francisco has more cases of AIDS per capita than any other city. The number of new victims, almost all of them homosexual men... \r\n\r\n-Fully half of San Francisco's 80,000 gay men already may carry the AIDS antibody. Since 1981, there have been 1,400 AIDS deaths here. \r\n\r\n-Studies show that about half the gay men in San Francisco are infected with the AIDS virus, HIV. \r\n\r\n-A totally new disease has appearedin the past couple of years that is spreading rapidly among homosexuals. \r\n\r\n-Well, I think it's because it's a gay cancer. \r\n\r\n-It appeared a year ago in New York's gay community, then in the gay communities in San Francisco and Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n-While gays were gaining in the courts and legislatures, a new disease was diminishing their numbers: AIDS, still incurable, still pervasive among homosexuals. This month the total number of Americans killed by AIDS will top the number of Americans killed in Vietnam. \r\n\r\n-We come to thank God for the life of Phil Howard, for all that he meant to all of you. \r\n\r\n-San Francisco's gay community, once the capital of gay liberation, has become a community of young men who spend much of their time dealing with death and dying. \r\n\r\n-Lord, have mercy. \r\n\r\n-Many people compare the experience of living through the AIDS epidemic to war. In this city alone, AIDS already has killed more than 5,000 people. That is three times the number of people from San Francisco, who died fighting in all the wars in this century. \r\n\r\n-You feel very helpless. There's absolutely nothing you can do. \r\n\r\n-Bob Ross publishes a gay newspaper called the Bay Area Reporter. Every week he prints obituaries of at least a dozen people in the area who died of AIDS. \r\n\r\n-AIDS is the judgment of God, and that's the title of the sermon tonight, "AIDS: The Judgment of God". \r\n\r\nYou say, "Well, I don't think God would send that judgment." Well, go back if you would to Deuteronomy chapter 28. In fact, God already said repeatedly throughout the Bible that disease or pestilence is a judgment that he would send. The Bibles uses the word "pestilence". We would normally use the word "disease". It's the same thing. It's germs; it's disease; it's something that's infected. Look at Deuteronomy chapter 28 verse 15, and let me just explain to you what Deuteronomy 28 is. It's a list of the curses upon those who would disobey the Lord. \r\n\r\n"But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:" - Deut 28:15 \r\n\r\n"The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it. The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish." - Deut 28:21-22 \r\n\r\n"The Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed." - Deut 28:27 \r\n\r\n-AIDS is not God's vengence upon the homosexual community. \r\n\r\n-Don't tell me that God won't send disease. Don't tell me that God won't send pestilence as a punishment. Don't tell me that the fact that our country today is filled with STD's isn't the judgment of God today, because it is! And you say, "Well, that has nothing to do with it." That's baloney! You know and I know that married, heterosexual, normal Christian people are not picking up these diseases. They're just not doing it. Unless they get a blood transfusion from one of these freaks, they're not going to get it. You get it from being promiscuous. You get it from living a life of sin, my friend, and anybody who's being honest with you would tell you that. Now go back to Romans chapter one. It's clear. \r\n\r\n"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet." - Rom 1:26-27 \r\n\r\nNow, I have my Bible here. This is a possession that I really prize. This is my grandma's New Testament. In Romans chapter one, my sweet old grandmother, right under the part where it says, "receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet", she wrote the word "AIDS". That's what Grandma said. She said- receiving in themselves that recompence, or what they deserve, or the judgment or punishment that they've earned, receiving in themselves that recompence of the error which was meet - she wrote "AIDS". \r\n\r\nThis is from the Centers for Disease Control. Here's what they say: that the AIDS rate, the rate of HIV, is fifty times higher for homosexuals. Did you hear that? Fifty times higher. You say, "Well, that's odd. I wonder how in the world this normal, natural, healthy, wonderful lifestyle would lead to fifty times as much of this deadly disease." \r\n\r\nWell, let me explain to you how they got fifty times as much AIDS, because it's right here in this article, which is a scientific article put out by two researchers, Bell and Weinberg, and they did a study of thousands and thousands of homos, just doing a study on their lifestyle, doing a survey, and here's what they found: They found that 28% of homos that they checked with - 28% had already had more than one thousand partners. Now, look. It's hard to even wrap your mind around a number like that, isn't it? A thousand? I mean, there's only 365 days in a year. I mean, just stop and think, a thousand different people. 28%. That's almost a third. Let's just round it down. Let's just call it a fourth. That means that if you know four homos, one of them has already surpassed the thousand mark, based on this information. \r\n\r\nNow, look. Do you think I made this up? Go research it. It's all fact. And then, there are about three other studies that were done that showed the same thing. So, I mean this was studied in different parts of the country, different time periods, one was done in the 70's, one was done in the 90's, and more than a quarter, more than one out of four had had a thousand - already - a thousand! I mean, that number boggles the mind. 28%. But it goes further than that. 43% - over 500. And that's already just bizarre. I mean, just off the charts. So if you know two of them, one of them has hit the 500 mark already. \r\n\r\n"How is that even possible, Pastor Anderson?" Well, that's because 79% of homos said that more than half of their partners are complete strangers. 79% said that more than half of their partners are complete strangers. Now do you understand why they're fifty times more likely to have AIDS? Not only that, but a mere 17% reported having less than fifty already. And I mean, look. They still have their whole life ahead of them. A mere 17% said, "At this point, I've had less than fifty." Only 17%. And this study showed that being monogamous, or being faithful to one partner was non-existant. \r\n\r\n-Homosexuality is a sin. \r\n\r\n-It was California Republican William Dannemeyer who recently declared on the House floor, "God's plan for man was Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve." Dannemeyer leads a group of conservative Republicans who hope to make AIDS a political issue. They meet to plan strategy for bringing controversial AIDS-related legislation to the House floor. \r\n\r\n-At some point, the public is going to demand action, frankly, to get on with protecting the public health. \r\n\r\n-...bath houses frequented by homosexual men. The House already has voted overwhelmingly to close them if federal authorities believe they help spread AIDS. In New York City, a Republican campaign proposal to close all businesses that cater mainly to homosexual men \r\n\r\n-...Gay bath houses, blamed for encouraging high-risk sex, were shut down by the city a year ago, but most had already closed for lack of customers. \r\n\r\n-The baths were ordered closed when city inspectors found evidence of sexual practices which they felt lead to the spread of AIDS. Owners of five of the bath houses plan to fight the order in court. \r\n\r\n-Congressman Dannemeyer charges that Democrats won't be tough enough on AIDS, because he says the party fears alienating homosexual voters. \r\n\r\n-They have opened up their party to the male homosexual community in America, and those members of congress or state legislature or county government who don't take those actions that are needed are going to pay the political price for not having done so. \r\n\r\n-I think it is one more instance of fag bashing. \r\n\r\n-Last weekend, Darrel Yates Rist predicted that the Mine Shaft would close. He had started going to the gay backroom bar ten years ago. But Saturday night, Rist went as a journalist - the last stop on a tour he had taken of city gay bath houses. \r\n\r\n-None of these clubs wants their clientele to die and no gay men in this city wants to die nor does he want his friends and lovers to die. -But the Mine Shaft's neighbors, the meat packers, don't believe Rist; they say they believe what they see. \r\n\r\n-They're making love in the street on top of cars and everything. This is men, grown men. I mean, that's not normal. \r\n\r\n-We've seen it all since we've been here. They try to pick us up. They come out drunk. \r\n\r\n-Sometimes in the morning you see needles on the floor here, and we have to work around it. You see, this is government meat inspected places here. \r\n\r\n-The meat handlers say it's gone on too long. Mayor Koch agrees in light of the AIDS crisis. \r\n\r\n-This is a matter that involves a lot of money to these people. They are selling death. Places where death can be distributed. We don't want that to go on. But nevertheless, they don't give a damn about it, apparently, because it's going on, and they're making money. \r\n\r\n-What they're doing is abnormal in the sense that, most of these people, they're not fit; they're not human beings; they have emotional problems. \r\n\r\n-You say, "No, no, Pastor Anderson. You don't understand. I saw on TV that they want to get married. They want to get married and be monogamous." No. Monogamy is non-existant. Here's the science. Here are the numbers: OK, 85% of straight married women in the United States claim to have been faithful to their spouse. Now, it's sad that it's that low, but, you know, that's what it is. Married straight women - 85% will say that they've been faithful. And 75% of straight married men will say that they've been faithful to their spouse, meaning that they have not committed adultery. But amongst homos, you know how many are saying - and this is just who's saying that they've been faithful - 4%. So 96% will just come right out and say, "not faithful, total adultery". So, it's only 4%. Not 40%; four. One, two, three, four per cent that will even claim to have been. \r\n\r\nBut is that what they show you on TV? "Oh, just let them get married if they love each other. Blah, blah, blah." No. The only reason they want to get married is just to make us think it's normal. \r\n\r\n-Through their disgusting lifestyle, the sodomites have spread their disease of AIDS throughout the population. People will often point out that sodomites are not the only ones who get AIDS, and that many straight people get AIDS as well. This is because sodomites who go both ways spread the disease to those who are promiscuous among the straight population. Also, the sodomites have spread their disease to drug users through the sharing of needles. In addition, there have been sodomites who knew they had HIV and yet purposely donated blood to infect the straight population. \r\n\r\n-The gay people are giving their blood knowing that it is contaminating people, and to me that is irresponsible and immoral. \r\n\r\n-It's a disease first detected in the gay community that has now spread beyond that, a disease experts are now calling a national epidemic. \r\n\r\n-We are faced with an epidemic which initially started in the gay community. But now we see it spreading to heterosexual - both men and women. \r\n\r\n-Up 'till now, AIDS has affected only homosexual men, intravenous drug abusers, Haitian immigrants, and hemophiliacs, but there is now conflicting scientific evidence that AIDS can be transmitted through blood transfusions, heterosexual relations... \r\n\r\nGay rights groups have attacked federal guidelines that now require Red Cross blood banks to ask homosexual men not to give blood. Gay leaders say such questions particularly in on-the-job blood drives can be a violation of privacy. But federal officials say they'll continue until the epidemic is brought under control. \r\n\r\n-Whatever causes AIDS destroys these blood cells, called "lymphocytes", which fight infection. The victims are then suceptible to various diseases. Drug addicts get AIDS from blood-contaminated needles, children from their mothers' blood in the womb. Others have gotten it from blood transfusions and blood products. But more than 70% of the victims are homosexual men who get it from sexual contact. \r\n\r\n-I have four friends that have died. I have two friends that are dying. I listen to them. Brilliant people. Brilliant people. \r\n\r\n-The Word of God is crystal clear on this subject, I'm going to be crystal clear on this subject, and people are going to be offended because they have been taught by Hollywood and taught by the mainstream media and they've been taught by the music and the TV shows that homosexuality is a normal alternative lifestyle and that they are normal people. That is not what the Bible teaches anywhere. And I'm going to show you a pattern in the Bible here. When the Bible talks about this subject, it's always the same old story playing out. You see, in Genesis 19, you have a city that is filled with these homos, with these sodomites, and these men in the city, instead of contenting themselves to just be a homo or get married to each other or whatever they want to do, what do they want to do? They want to go after the two guys who just got into the town, the two innocent visitors who march into town, and they say, "We want those two guys." The whole town is there. They say, "We want to bring those two guys out and we want to know them." \r\n\r\n"But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door." - Gen 19:4-9 \r\n\r\nAnd you say, "Oh, they just want to have a loving relationship." OK. If they want to have a loving relationship, then why is it that when Lot tells them no, they say, "We're going to do worse to you than what we were going to do to them"? Does that sound like they were going to do a good thing to them or a bad thing? \r\n\r\nThis is actually a very significant event. This is not just an obscure Bible story. This is something that the Bible references over and over and over again. All throughout the Old Testament, all throughout the New Testament, 54 times the term "Sodom" or "sodomite" is mentioned. Look at Judges 19:22. We find a very similar story. Here's a guy who's travelling with his concubine, or his live-in girlfriend, and a servant. And he shows up in a town. It's a similar story except in this story he's trying to find a place to stay. He can't find anywhere to stay. An old man comes in from the field and says, "I will let you stay at my house but you guys should not spend the night in the street." Very similar story. Look at Judges 19:22. \r\n\r\n"Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly. Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light. And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold. And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place." - Judges 19:22-28 \r\n\r\nShe's dead. And you say, "Well, this isn't a very pleasant story. This isn't a very pleasant sermon." No. It's not a very pleasant subject! But this, my friend, is reality that you're seeing tonight. You see, what you see on TV is a lie. What you hear in the music is a lie. What you see in the Hollywood movie is a lie. This is the truth. And when you come to church, you should expect to hear the truth about every subject, and tonight you're going to hear the truth about the sodomites. \r\n\r\n-The campaign against the ordinance has been vicious. Gays are being called a dangerous and violent group that corrupts children and infects the community with AIDS. \r\n\r\n-That looks innocent enough, doesn't it? Lots of young people hitchhike. It seems like a good way to get from one place to another. But sometimes there are dangers involved that never meet the eye. Let's take the case of Jimmy Barnes. Jimmy played baseball all afternoon and he didn't feel like walking home so he decided to thumb a ride. He'd done it a hundred times before and he didn't think anything was unusual when the driver struck up a friendly conversation. In fact, he seemed like a real nice guy. He asked Jimmy if he played baseball in the park often. Jimmy told him they practice three times a week and played a rival group on Friday afternoon. The stranger was a good listener too, and it only seemed minutes before they pulled up in front of Jimmy's house. When Jimmy got out, the stranger gave him a friendly pat. Then he told him he'd see him again because he always drove by the park on his way home. Sure enough, the following day when Jimmy finished playing ball, well, the man was there waiting. They stopped at a drive-in and the stranger treated him to a Coke. During their conversation he told several off-color jokes, but Jimmy had heard others before and, well, it made him feel big to so easily win the confidence of an older person. \r\n\r\nThe following Saturday they went fishing together. By now they were using first names. Ralph said it was more friendly. Jimmy hadn't enjoyed himself so much in a long time. Then during lunch Ralph showed him some pornographic pictures. Jimmy knew he shouldn't be interested but, well, he was curious. What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick. A sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious. A sickness of the mind. You see, Ralph was a homosexual, a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex. But by now, Jimmy felt a fondness for Ralph and they continued to go places together. Ralph was generous and took Jimmy many interesting places and did many nice things for him. He bought presents and even gave him money. But payments were expected in return. You see, Jimmy hadn't recognized Ralph's approach soon enough. When Ralph first asked Jimmy to go fishing alone, he should have discussed it with his parents or teacher. Finally Jimmy told his parents and they reported it to the juvinile authorities. Ralph was arrested and Jimmy was released on probation in the custody of his parents. \r\n\r\nBut all homosexuals are not passive. Some resort to violence as in the case of Mike Merrit. In the heat of competition, no one noticed the man who sat and watched. And when the game broke up and the others left, Mike decided to stay and practice a little longer. The stranger joined him. He was friendly and, well, it was better than playing alone. But after a few shots Mike realized he'd already overstayed his time and suggested he'd better leave. The stranger told him if he'd like to stay longer he'd be glad to drive him home when they finished. It sounded great to Mike. A chance to play longer and get a ride home, too. When they finished the stranger told him he'd make a fine player some day if he got lots of practice. The companionship, the praise, the friendly attitude dispelled any misgivings Mike might have had about going with a stranger. He probably never realized until too late that he was riding in the shadow of death, but sometime that evening, Mike Merrit traded his life for a newspaper headline. \r\n\r\nPublic restrooms can often be a hangout for the homosexual. One never knows when the homosexual is about. He may appear normal, and it may be too late when you discover he is mentally ill. So keep with your group and don't go off alone with strangers. \r\n\r\n-"Well, that was the Old Testament." OK, well, let's go to the New Testament then. 2nd Peter chapter two, almost to the very end of the Bible. \r\n\r\nIt says in verse six, "And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow," because that's how he felt about it back then. That was before he had evolved on that issue. Is that what it says? It says that he turned Sodom and Gomorrha, and condemned them with an overthrow, he turned it into ashes, "making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly". That's why in the New Testament at the end of the Bible, he's saying, "Hey, let me tell you something. That was an example unto those that afterwards should live ungodly." "And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked". It doesn't say, "the alternative lifestyle of the wicked". It says, "vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked". Go to Jude, just a few pages to the right in your Bible. Jude verse seven. Just a couple pages over, second to last book in the Bible. Jude verse seven: \r\n\r\n"Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." - Jude 7 \r\n\r\nAgain, emphasizing the fact that that is supposed to be an example unto us today where we can look at that example and say, "This is what God thinks about that sin." And you say, "Well, what was the sin? What was the big sin?" He tells us right here what the sin was. You say, "Why did he rain fire and brimstone? Was it just because of the violent way that they were trying to carry out their lust? Was it just the violence that they were trying to do?" Well, the Bible says it's because they had given themselves over to fornication, going after strange flesh. And, you know, "strange" has a synonym: "queer". OK? It is not normal for a man to go after another man's flesh. That's strange flesh. And he says that they gave themselves over to fornication and went after strange flesh, and that they are set forth an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Go to Romans one. Romans chapter number one. A lot about this in the New Testament, my friend. We're not even going to look at all the New Testament passages for sake of time. We could look up all 54 times that the word "Sodom" or "sodomite" is mentioned in the Bible, but it would take too long to go to all the scriptures. And people think, "Oh, the Bible barely touches on that." Or, "Oh, the Bible doesn't really talk about that." Look, 54 times the word "Sodom" is used. Now, the passage I'm taking you to in Romans one deals with this subject and doesn't even mention the word "Sodom" or "sodomite". So, I mean there are more than 54 scriptures to deal with here. I mean, there are a lot of scriptures. Genesis nine deals with this subject. Again, no mention of the word "Sodom". And so, this is a subject that the Bible deals with quite a bit, actually. Look at Romans chapter one and let's just let the Bible do the talking tonight, because the Bible says so much. Look at verse number 18. It says: \r\n\r\n"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:" - Romans 1:18-26 \r\n\r\nNow, do you remember how the word "vile" was used back in Judges 19, when the old man said, "Do not so vile a thing"? What does the word "vile" mean? Somebody help me out. What does the word "vile" mean? Disgusting. What's another... Sick. And not in a good way. You know, "vile" means disgusting, gross. Would that be another word that you would probably use for "vile"? That's what the word V-I-L-E means. And the Bible says here that, "For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections". For what cause? The fact that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God. The fact that they rejected God, they rejected the evidence that he is the Creator of the world, they rejected all the things that he gave them and the good things that he did for them. And keep reading. It says, "God gave them up unto vile affections". \r\n\r\n"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet." - Romans 1:27 \r\n\r\nThe wording that God uses to describe this activity of men with men - he used the word "vile", he used the word "unseemly", he used the word, it's "not convenient", "convenient" meaning it doesn't come naturally. He used the word "against nature", he used the word "uncleanness", and he said he gave them unto vile affections, and he says here: \r\n\r\n"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;" - Romans 1:28\r\n\r\nNow let me ask you something. According to verse 28 here, which came first here, them rejecting God, or God rejecting them? Which came first? It's pretty clear, isn't it? I mean, it says like, "First, here's what they did. They refused to acknowledge God. They refused to worship God. They refused to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. They reduced God to the image of a man. They reduced God to the image of an animal or a beast. They did not like to retain God in their knowledge, meaning they hated God so much they don't even want to think about God. They don't even want to remember tha there is a God." And he says that that is what led to them being given over to a reprobate mind. And three different times it says God gave them up; God gave them up; God gave them over. And then people today still - 99% of evangelical Christianity or Baptists that you talk to will say, "I don't think God gave them up. I don't believe God gave them over. I don't believe God gave them up. I don't think God had anything to do with it." Am I telling the truth? You want to take a poll with me? If we were to go around and ask all the evangelical Christians and Baptists in this area, "Do you think God had anything to do with these people becoming perverted or becoming a reprobate or becoming vile?"..."No!" "No!" But what does the Bible say? It says it. \r\n\r\n"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers," - Romans 1:29\r\n\r\nAre we not continuing with the same thought? And isn't "being filled" talking about the people that we were just talking about? They are being filled with these things? So, he just said, "even as they" - Who's the "they"? Well, in verse 27 he said men with men burning in their lust one toward another". "And even as they" - So who's the "they"? The men who burn in their lust one toward another. "Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; Being filled with all unrighteousness". So what is that saying? It's saying that these men with men who burn in their lust one toward another are filled with all unrighteousness. So is this the only area they're messed up in? I mean, other than that, they're great people if it weren't for this one thing that they lust after other men. Is that what the Bible says? No. It says that they were also filled with all unrighteousness. Now, what does "all" mean? Yeah. Thank you. It says, "Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication" - that goes without saying - "wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy" - what's the next word? - "murder". Now, who believes that? Who believes the Bible tonight? That's what the Bible says: they're filed with murder. He says, "debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters" - what are the next three words? - "haters of God". Now, isn't that what God called them back in Psalm 81? "Haters of God, despiteful, proud" - What's that event that they have again, where they march up and down the street? What's that called again? Oh, Phoenix Pride. Oh, Gay Pride. Yeah. I think the Bible mentions that here. "Proud". He says, "boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful". \r\n\r\nNow, is this consistent with Genesis 19 in the story of Sodom? Because what happened in the story of Sodom? Two strangers walk into town, innocent guys, they're having dinner, they sit down to eat a meal with Lot, a knock comes at the door, and they say, "Bring those guys out that we may know them. We want to get to know these guys in a way that's carnal." And they say, "Oh, nope. You can't have these guys." "OK. Well, we'll do worse to you than what we were going to do to them!" No mercy. No listening to reason. No placating them. Judges 19 - similar story. Men of the city come knocking at the door. "Bring those two guys out." You know? And they will not be satisfied. And did they show any mercy on that woman that they abused? They abused that woman all night until she was dead. That's what the Bible said in Judges 19. And you know what people will lie to you and say? They'll say this: "Oh, these homos, they're just not attracted to women." Is that Biblical? Every single homo in the Bible went both ways. Every single one from Genesis to Revelation. Whether it's the story of Ham in Genesis 9, whether it's the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, it talks about how the men of the city had wives and children, the young of the city. When we go to Judges 19, we see that they basically went after this woman, also. See, that's why in Leviticus 20:13 it says, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman...". It doesn't say he's lying exclusively with mankind as opposed to lying with a woman. It says, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." You say, "Well, you have that verse memorized? You don't even have to turn there?" You know, you might want to make that a memory verse too, especially if you don't like this sermon. You may need that to be on a 3x5 card in your pocket this week - OK? - which I've done in the past and you need to do today if you're not clear on this doctrine. \r\n\r\n"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them." - Romans 1:32 \r\n\r\n-Homosexuality is illegal in many countries of the world today. Homosexuality has historically been illegal in the United States, and was still illegal in some places until as late as 2003. But bizarrely, Christians today are being taught in their churches that homosexuality should be legal. Other pastors will admit that it should be illegal, but are vague on what the punishment should be. The Bible only names one punishment for the crime of homosexuality: "They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." \r\n\r\n-We know, to a certainy, that AIDS is transmitted in great measure by homosexual conduct. The thought of removing that statute from the books which prohibits homosexual conduct does not seem all that timely to me. \r\n\r\n-Many people, even if they may not be the majority, regard it as their right to have free choice in choosing who they love, who they want to have sex with, and don't believe that the state should get involved. \r\n\r\n-It's not the state; it is the society. \r\n\r\n-But you signed it into law. \r\n\r\n-Yes. But I'm acting on behalf of the society. It's not just the state. It is the society, and that's why I would like to advise the Europeans and the western groups that this is one area which should be a no-go area because if they want a real confrontation with us, this is one area where they're not going to make our people budge. -But what about the equality of an individual, as the western countries would argue, to have the right to choose what they want for themselves, that just by virtue of being a human being, they have certain human rights, one of which is to express themselves freely in the way that they choose? \r\n\r\n-We cannot accept that behaving unnaturally is a human right. \r\n\r\n-Why not? \r\n\r\n-I was regarding it as an inborn problem. \r\n\r\n-A genetic link to homosexuality? \r\n\r\n-Genetic distortion. That was my argument. But now our scientists have knocked this one out, and once you argue that it is a question of choice, then really you have lost the argument as far as the Ugandans are concerned. \r\n\r\n-Do you think that by signing the bill, you're taking Uganda backwards? \r\n\r\n-Not at all. Not at all. Uganda's the way it has always been. \r\n\r\nThe Ugandans have never supported - our society system immemorial has never supported homosexuals. \r\n\r\n-What is your message to western human rights groups, to President Obama, to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people? \r\n\r\n-Respect African societies and their values. If you don't agree, just keep quiet. Let us manage our society, then we will see. If we are wrong, we shall find out by ourselves. Just the way we don't interfere with yours. \r\n\r\n-Do you personally dislike homosexuals? \r\n\r\n-Of course. They are disgusting. What sort of people are they? How can you go - I never knew what they were doing. That's how I've been told recently, that what they do is terrible. Disgusting. But I was ready to ignore that if there was proof that that's how he is born, abnormal. But now, the proof is not there. \r\n\r\n-Is this about politics more than morality and religion or culture? \r\n\r\n-Not at all. \r\n\r\n-Because there are many critics that have said this is about 2016; this is about the elections and the majority of people in this country support what you are doing. They support anti-gay legislation. \r\n\r\n-But why had I refused to sign it? Why had I refused to sign the bill if that were the case? I had refused to sign it because I wanted - and I was also going to sign it - maybe they would have changed it for me to sign it until I was confronted by the science, which I demanded from them. "You show me whether..." \r\n\r\n-It's made you very popular, signing this bill, even more so than you are. There are people in this country that would vote for you because of what you did today. The MP's will win their seats because of what you did today. \r\n\r\n-That's not my intention. My intention was the truth, the facts, and what is good for our country, our society. \r\n\r\n-Turn to Leviticus 20:13, because I actually discovered the cure for AIDS. OK? Now, this is the cure for AIDS. OK? And, you know, everybody's talking about, "Let's have an AIDS-free world by 2020", or, "Let's have an AIDS- free...". Look. We could have an AIDS-free world by Christmas. You know. OK, it wouldn't be totally AIDS-free, but we'd be like 90-some% AIDS-free by Christmas if we would follow this. OK, here's what the Bible says. Leviticus 20:13. "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman," OK. It says even "both of them have commited an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." And that, my friend, is the cure for AIDS. It was right there in the Bible all along. And they're out spending billions of dollars in research and testing. It's curable. Right there. Because if you executed the homos like God recommends, you wouldn't have all this AIDS running rampant. \r\n\r\n-Good evening. Those hateful words are from the mouth of a Tempe pastor preaching that God's Word says that killing gay people is the only way to get rid of AIDS by Christmas. Pastor Steven Anderson has agreed to join us tonight for an exclusive one-on-one interview. Pastor Anderson, thanks for coming in. \r\n\r\n-Thanks for having me on. \r\n\r\n-I have to be honest. When I heard your sermon, it sounded like the rantings of someone who is either a hatemonger or a religious zealot, and I'm wondering, which are you? \r\n\r\n-Well, I'm a religious zealot, and I love the Bible. I love God's Word. I believe that the law of the Lord is perfect, and Leviticus 20:13 clearly says, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." And as a Christian I believe the Bible and that's where I get my belief. \r\n\r\n-Doesn't the ten commandments - isn't the first commandment "Thou shalt not kill"? \r\n\r\n-No. The first commandment is "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." But of course... \r\n\r\n-Is "Thou shalt not kill" one of the commandments? \r\n\r\n-Yes it is, but what you have to understand is that the Bible commands that certain people be put to death, not by me, not by Christians. It's obviously not my job or the job of any Christian to go out and kill anybody, and I've never taught anything like that, but rather that the government's job is to punish criminals and to execute those who've committed capital crimes, and according to the Bible, homosexuality's a capital crime, and I didn't write the Bible. \r\n\r\n-Some would say that just as the Taliban and the ISIS fighters have perverted Islam and made it violent to fit their vision of the world, that that's what you're doing, is you're perverting Christianity to fit your vision of the world. \r\n\r\n-Well, let the viewer read for themself. Let them pull the Bible off their shelf and look up Leviticus 20:13 and then let them be the judge. Intelligent people will listen to the entire sermon "AIDS: The Judgement of God" and will pull their Bible off their shelf and read Leviticus 20:13. \r\n\r\n-I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but did you say that if people perceive you as a hatemonger or your church as a hate group, so be it? \r\n\r\n-Absolutely. I don't care how people perceive me. They called Jesus Beelzebub. They nailed him to the cross. And Jesus said that they hated him because he testified of their works that their works were evil. That's what I'm doing. That's why they hate me. \r\n\r\n-Alright, Pastor Steven Anderson, thanks for coming in. \r\n\r\n-Thank you. \r\n\r\n-And if you'd like to watch the entire interview with Pastor Anderson you can go to 12news.azcentral.com. \r\n\r\n-We know what they are and we have not been fooled by TV and Hollywood. The Bible says that they're full of all this unrighteousness and uncleanness and filth and iniquity and stone them with stones, etc., etc. And look. I'm not going to stone them with stones. I don't believe in taking the law into my own hands. This is not a violent sermon about harming anyone. Let me tell you something. It was supposed to be the law of the land. Now, when Moses was in charge, it was the law of the land. And when this country was founded, it was the law of the land in America. You know, study your history and in America it was the death penalty on homos even in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, you know, going back to the early 1600's of this country. And in those days it was against the law, and even until 2003 there were some laws on the books against it. It's only since 2003. The Bible says in 1 Kings 14:24, \r\n\r\n"And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel." - 1 Kings 14:24 \r\n\r\n"And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made." - 1 Kings 15:12 \r\n\r\n"And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land." - 1 Kings 22:46 \r\n\r\n"And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove." - 2 Kings 23:7 \r\n\r\nSo look. We don't see a tolerance here of sodomites. \r\n\r\n-There's a new HIV infection every single minute. There's a new AIDS death every half hour. There are 212 deaths - I'm sorry. There are 212 new cases every day of full-blown AIDS. \r\n\r\n-Indeed for the forseeable future throughout the world, the number of people dying from AIDS will continue to increase dramatically. \r\n\r\n-When you got AIDS, did it make you think again about being gay? Did it make you rethink that lifestyle? Did it make you regret anything you've done? \r\n\r\n-No. I have absolutely no regrets. I do not feel guilty about anything that I've done. \r\n\r\n-It's morally repulsive. It's just physically repulsive. It's just repulsive across the board. And we need to get a Biblical view tonight of this subject and not be deceived by the world that we live in to tell us, "Oh, we just need to just be more loving and everything's going to be fine." You know what? That's funny, because that's what everybody's doing and it's not working. All the churches who are like, "Oh, let's just open our doors and just love everybody." Look. No queers allowed in this church. And all God's people said: \r\n\r\n[Congregation] Amen! \r\n\r\nThere's no queers allowed. "Is that even legal?" \r\n\r\n[Galatians 5:23] Against such there is no law. \r\n\r\nNo homos will ever be allowed in this church as long as I'm the pastor here. Never! \r\n\r\n-The time has come for Christians to stop listening to the media, the politicians, and the watered-down preachers of our day, and to get back to a biblical view of the sodomites. We must protect ourselves and our children from these dangerous disease-filled predators. Our nation has become a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah and it is our job as Christians to hold forth the Word of Life in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom we shine as lights in the world. \r\n\r\n-It's filthy! It's vile! They're wicked! And AIDS is the judgment of God tonight!	Documentary	2017-04-17 22:45:33.102826	2017-04-23 14:21:52.886947	aids-the-judgment-of-god-documentary	0

17	The Truth about Hinduism	Pastor Anderson	2017-03-10 03:00:00	20170309P_TheTruthAboutHinduism.mp3	k6NbqjRZr0Q		f	Faithful Word Baptist Church	Narrator 1:\tHinduism is the oldest living religion in the world and the third largest. More than one billion Hindus live in 150 different countries, mostly in India. The United States alone is home to over two million Hindus.\r\n\r\nNarrator 2:\tCurrently about 15% of the world's population subscribes to Hinduism, with roughly 99% of Hindus residing in India and Nepal. By 2050 Hinduism is expected to grow by 34% to about 1.4 billion at [inaudible 00:00:40] Global.\r\n\r\nNat Geo:\tSo it's February 2013, I'm here on the shores of the mighty Ganges River to be witnessed to one of the greatest and biggest human gatherings on the planet. It's actually a Hindu religious festival that takes places every twelve years and they call it the Maha kumbh mela. \r\n\r\nThere they come wave upon wave of spiritually charged naked warriors. Look at this. Whoa. It looks like an army, it's amazing. \r\n\r\nNarrator 3:\tFor a Hindu the Mandir is the home of God on earth, so for a Hindu to visit a temple it's like visiting God. And the reason why a Hindu would go to a Mandir or a temple is because he wishes to catch sight of the deity of his choice. He wishes to see God. You might wish to announce your presence to God. So, sometimes the bell is rung to say that "I am here, oh Lord, please look at me, I've come here to visit you." \r\n\r\nAnd as soon as he goes there of course his main attention is drawn toward the deity of his choice, the central deity, the key deity in every temple, and the temple that we are visiting today is devoted to the idea of God is female, is the mother Goddess. So he will immediately be drawn to the central shrine and pay his respects by bowing down to the image in the center of the temple. \r\n\r\nAnd the Hindus are not apologetic about using images to worship God because this is the best way, the symbolic way of reaching out to God. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tIdolatry is worshiping devils. Are you there in Revelation 9? What does it say? "They repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood." That's what it is to worship devils. It's worshiping carved and molten images.\r\n\r\nPaul:\t"What say I thee that the idol was anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything, but I say that the things, which the gentiles sacrificed, they sacrificed to devils and not to God. And I would not that she should have fellowship with devils."\r\n\r\nPastor:\tSo what he's saying is that it's easy to look at the idol and to think of itself as just a hunk of wood, a hunk of stone, it really isn't anything. It's an inanimate object, but Paul is saying here that it goes deeper than that because when they're bowing down to an idol it's not that they're just worshiping an inanimate object, but that literally they are worshiping devils he said.\r\n\r\nPaul:\tThe Bible says "The rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood." And the Bible said in that verse that when they worship those Gods of gold and gods of silver they're actually worshiping devils, they're actually worshiping demons. The Bible says that the things which the gentiles offer in sacrifice unto idols they sacrifice unto devils and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tBut Mark Chapter 5 is I think the best example in the Bible of someone who is demon possessed. And I think that by looking at this passage we can see what it looks like to have fellowship with devils and we can identify other practices in our world that are demonic. \r\n\r\nLet's get a hint here in Mark 5:1. "They came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes, and when he," Jesus, "was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains. Because that he had been oft bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Neither could any man tame him. And always, night and day he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped him."\r\n\r\nLet's look at some attributes of this man who's possessed of devils. First of all he has his dwelling among the tombs. He loves the graveyard, the cemetery, the cremation ground. Whatever is associated with death, that's where this guy's hanging out \r\n\r\nNarrator 5:\tThey eat leftovers from human dead bodies. They drink in a bowl made of human scalp and they wear ash from a human buyer. Known as the followers of Lord Shiva these are the Aghoris. A place considered dreadful by others is home for Aghoris, the Hindu cremation ground. Followers of Lord Shiva, the most powerful of all Hindu Gods and considered the destroyer. These Aghoris follow occult practices dating back to the 5th Century AD. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 10:\t[foreign language 00:06:32].\r\n\r\nNarrator 5:\tThe Kamakhya temple situated on top of the Nilachal hill in Guwahati in North East India is the center of widely practiced powerful tantric of black magic cult in India. Legend has it that the temple of Kamakhya Devi consort of Lord Shiva, came into existence when the Lord was carrying the corpse of his wife. And her yoni or the female genitalia fell to the ground at the spot where the temple now stands. \r\n\r\nThe Ambubachi Mela, the second largest religious congregation of people in the world is held at the temple every year during monsoon as the devotees believe that the Goddess Kamakhya goes through her menstrual cycle at that time. Therefore the temple remains closed for three days. On the fourth day the temple reopens and thousands of devotees and sadhus of all sects make a mad rush to receive the unique and highly powerful prasad, which is small bits of cloth supposedly moist with the menstrual fluid of Goddess Kamakhya. \r\n\r\nMany of the Aghoris come here during this time before starting their initiation for the blessings of Goddess Kamakhya. The life of an Aghori sadhu is not easy. To become like them one has to meditate for about 12 years and complete certain rituals under the guidance of an Aghori guru in order to enhance one's spiritual strength. Aghoris use wood from piers, clothes from dead bodies, ash of burnt bodies and the like in their rituals.\r\n\r\nThere are certain rules one must follow to become an Aghori, firstly an Aghori must find a teacher and do what the teacher tells him to do. An Aghori must find a human skull known as the kapala and use only this as his food bowl before initiation. An Aghori must apply the ash of a buyer to his body during meditation. The final part of the ritual requires eating of rotten human flesh, and also meditating while sitting on a dead corpse symbolizing the rise from shava to Shiva. He should live his entire life at the cremation ground and eat and drink only through the kapala.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tBecause he's possessed with devils, the Bible says "All they that hate me love death." The second thing that we see is that no man can bind him, no, not with chains and the Bible uses the word at the end of verse four, "Neither could any man tame him." This man is acting wild, like unto an animal. He's living like a beast not like a human being. He's uncivilized and savage. We are to live civilized and clothed. And by the way, did I mention this guy's naked? \r\n\r\nThey come to Jesus and see him that was possessed with he devil and had the legion, sitting and - what? - clothed. Why was that a shock because he'd been naked previously. He's sitting clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid, so the next attribute about him was that he was naked.\r\n\r\nNarrator 5:\tMany of the Aghoris roam around naked, representing the true human form and their detachment from this world of mortals who according to them live in a world of illusion or maya. Through this they transcend human feelings of love, hatred, jealousy and pride. \r\n\r\nThere are many Aghoris walking the streets of northern India with their own kapala or human skull cap. These Aghoris eat things like rotten food, leftover food from garbage dumps, animal feces and animal urine. They regularly perform the rituals to attain the highest level in Aghoratva, the Enlightenment. Aghoris believe that God exists in everything, whether it is cow dung or food. Nothing is unholy or inauspicious for them. Everything is sacred.\r\n\r\nThey gain their powers by doing things that are considered unholy or unclean by society. The more they blur the line between clean and unclean, holy and unholy, good and bad, the more powers they get.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tAnd then another attribute in verse five is that he's very self-destructive. In fact, he's cutting himself with stones.\r\n\r\nNarrator 5:\tAghoris follow the simple rule that the universe resides in them and they try to attain enlightenment by self-realization. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tSee, these were the example of their wonderful enlightenment. This one guy, he had his arms stuck up in the air like this.\r\n\r\nSpeaker 9:\tHello [foreign language 00:11:51].\r\n\r\nNat Geo:\tAs I'm being accepted in this community, I'm privileged to meet one of the most sacred sadhus here. He's taken extreme self-sacrifice to the next level. \r\n\r\nHow long has he had the arm raised like that?\r\n\r\nNarrator 7:\tHis arm has been raised more than 40 years.\r\n\r\nNat Geo:\tMore than 40 years? And so, he never cut his nails for 40 years, right?\r\n\r\nNarrator 7:\tFor 40 years it's been like that. He raised his arm and never put it down.\r\n\r\nNat Geo:\tIs it something you needed to do for yourself or for someone else?\r\n\r\nSpeaker 9:\t[foreign language 00:12:24] \r\n\r\nNarrator 7:\tThis is the ancient yoga.\r\n\r\nNat Geo:\tSo, I'm sure if you told people in California that this is yoga, they'd faint. You know, all these girls or guys who do yoga over there. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tHis arm was all withered. It looked like a tree branch. His arm was stuck that way and his arm was like dying. And his hand was all contorted. And his fingernails were grown just into spirals, okay? The guy who's there interviewing him from the National Geographic or whatever is like, "Oh, this is really cool, you know?" Being self-destructive to your body is demonic.\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tYeah!\r\n\r\nPastor:\tWhat difference is there from cutting yourself, sleeping outside under the do of heaven, not grooming, not cutting your nails, letting your nails grow like bird talons, letting your hair become like eagle's feathers, look, that isn't right. That's savage. That's uncivilized. That's wicked. That's demonic. That's not how God ... God said your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. Anoint your head and wash your face, that's what the Bible said. \r\n\r\nYou see, we need to have respect and honor for our bodies and not abuse our bodies, not to misuse our bodies. See the Bible says, "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you and that you're not your own, but you're bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's." So, our body belongs to God. When we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is our savior, we're purchased with the blood of Christ and we belong to him. And we need to not abuse our body. \r\n\r\nThis book right here, which is one of the main Hindu scriptures, probably the most famous of the Hindu scriptures, known as the Bhagavad Gita. I'm going to use this book to show the false teachings of Hinduism and I'm going to use this book to show what the truth is from God's word, the Bible. I'm going to make six points tonight about the false teachings of Hinduism that come from this book, the Bhagavad Gita, which is just another language for the Song of the Lord. That's what this means. It's Sanskrit. \r\n\r\nNumber one, the Lord, because remember it's called the Song of the Lord. The Lord of the Bhagavad Gita, the god of this book is not the god of the Bible.\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tRight.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tOkay? A lot of people just think, "Well, hey, as long as you're worshiping God, as long you're worshiping the creator, there's only one God. So, we're all worshiping the same god." This is the philosophy that's out there with people, especially as we approach the end times and we get into kind of a one world religion new world order type of a thing. So, this book teaches about a god that is not the God of the Bible. And in fact, the teachings of Hinduism are contrary to the teachings of the Bible. So, you're turning to Revelations 12. Let me read for you some excerpts from the Bhagavad Gita where the Lord talks about himself. And you tell me if this is the God of the Bible.\r\n\r\nNarrator 6:\t"I am Kamadhuk, the cow that fulfills all desires. I'm Kandarpa, the power of sex. I'm Vasukhi, the king of snakes. I'm Ananta, the cosmic serpent. I am Yama, the god of death. I am Prahlada, born among the demons."\r\n\r\nPastor:\tThat's what the Lord is saying that he is the king of snakes, the cosmic serpent, the god of death and that he is born among the demons. He says, shortly before that, "Among words, I am the syllable Om." Listen to this quote from the Bhagavad Gita and tell me if this is the same god as the God of the Bible.\r\n\r\nNarrator 6:\t"Oh Lord, I've seen within your body all the gods and every kind of living creature. I see Brahma, the creator seated on a lotus. I see the ancient sages and the celestial serpents."\r\n\r\nPastor:\tNow let me ask you something. Does the Bible teach of us celestial serpents? Is God ever called the Lord of the snakes and the cosmic serpent and the God of death? Now, the Bible says in Revelations 12:9. \r\n\r\nPaul:\t"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him." \r\n\r\nPastor:\tSo, the Bible calls the devil a great dragon and a serpent. According to the Bible, the great serpent is the devil. It's Satan. In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord says, "Well, I'm the cosmic serpent. I'm the God of Death. I am the king of snakes," and so forth. The god of the Bhagavad Gita is not the God of the Bible, but he's actually Satan himself is what we get from that.\r\n\r\nThe second false teaching of the Bhagavad Gita is the teaching of reincarnation.\r\n\r\nNarrator 3:\tReincarnation is the central Indian belief that the soul Atman is reborn in a new body time and time again to grow and mature through all the experiences human life has to offer. Eventually, every soul achieves salvation by realizing its oneness with God and is no longer reborn. Hindus do not believe in a Satan or an eternal Hell. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tNow let me just start out by explaining this book to you just a little bit. The backdrop of this book is that there's a character named Arjuna and he has to fight in a war against some of his own cousins and relatives and uncles, and some of his former teachers from his childhood because he's involved in a civil war in ancient India. Sort of like in the American Civil War they say it's brother against brother and father against son. \r\n\r\nSo, at the beginning of the book he is expected to go to battle to fight to put the proper heir upon the throne and get rid of the guy who's the wrong king that shouldn't be on the throne. So, he has to go to war, but he's very upset about this because he feels terrible about going into battle against his own friends and relatives and loved ones. He says, "Man, it would almost be better to die than to go out and kill these people who I know and love." So, he's very conflicted about killing these people. So, this is how the book starts and that's sort of the backdrop and the theme that's underlying the book.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting is right at the beginning of this book, as the explanation of why Arjuna should go into battle and fight and not really worry about killing these people. It's not really a big deal to kill them is because they're going to be reincarnated anyway. \r\n\r\nNarrator 6:\t"You speak sincerely. But your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor the dead as the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth and old age, so too at the time of death, he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these changes. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in this battle. One believes he is the slayer. Another believes he is the slayed. Both are ignorant. There is neither slayer nor slayed. As one abandons worn out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the self who lives within. Death is inevitable for the living. Birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable, you should not sorrow. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tBasically, what he's saying is, "You know what? If you kill people, so what? They were going to die anyway. And it's just pretty much like changing clothes because they die and then they just get a new body." Now you can see how dangerous this teaching is because it could lead people to easily have no respect for human life by thinking to themselves, "Well, you know, if I kill somebody, I'm just moving them on to the next stage. It's like here, let me change your clothes for ya."\r\n\r\nNow this is not what the Bible teaches about life. The Bible teaches a great sanctity for human life. Here's what the Bible says, "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this, the Judgment." A lot of people believe in reincarnation. But the Bible says there is no reincarnation. The Bible says it's appointed unto men once to die and after this, the Judgment. And after you die, you're either going to go to Heaven or you're going to go to hell.\r\n\r\nGandhi, when people brought up to him the fact that, "You're saying the Bhagavad Gita is your main scripture," because Gandhi said, "This is my spiritual dictionary. This is the book that I live by every day, the Bhagavad Gita." Not the Bible, not the New Testament, but rather this book. People brought up to him the fact, "Well, you know, if you're so into non-violence, why is this book your main teaching when chapters one and two is all about how, hey, going into war and killing people is not even a big deal because it's just like changing clothes? No big deal."\r\n\r\nHere's what he said to that. He said, "Well, don't get stuck in chapter one. It gets better. And don't get too hung up on that. If you read the whole book, it totally takes a different direction after that." But here you can go way forward into the book into chapter 11 and it says the same thing. Listen to this.\r\n\r\nNarrator 6:\tI am time, the destroyer of all. I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. Therefore, arise, Arjuna. Conquer your enemies and enjoy the glory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors. You will only be my instrument. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tSo, what's he saying? Well, everybody's going to die eventually anyway. Time is going to eventually kill everybody, so you might as well kill them now. I mean that's a pretty weird philosophy. That's a pretty weird teaching. But when you have this attitude that Hinduism teaches, well, that you're just going to be reincarnated and you're just going to keep coming back, so what's the big deal? If you die, someone else dies, if you kill someone. Whatever. They are coming back anyway. Don't sweat it. \r\n\r\nIs that what the Bible teaches? Look at Revelations 20:10. \r\n\r\nPaul:\t"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and forever. And I saw a great white throne. And in that sat on it from whose face the earth and the Heaven fled away and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books were open and another book was open, which is the Book of Life. And the dead would judge out of those things which were written in the books according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead, which were in it. And death in Hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged, every man, according to their works. And death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire."`\r\n\r\nPastor:\tNow according to verse 10 of this chapter, the lake of fire is a place where when people go there they're tormented day and night forever and ever. Do you see that, at the end of verse 10? That's what happened to the antichrist and the beast. And that's what happened to the false prophet who went there. They're tormented day and night forever and ever. And then we go down a few verses. And whosoever's name is not found written in the Book of Life, they are cast into that same lake of fire. So, the Bible teaches an eternal punishment of hell. The Bible teaches that those who die without Jesus as their savior, they don't just switch clothes and do another body and get reborn. There is no reincarnation. They go to Hell and they stay there for all eternity. That's what the Bible teaches. \r\n\r\nWhereas those who believes on Jesus Christ, Jesus said, "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." So, yeah, if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, sure, then you do just discard this body and you go to be with the Lord and eventually you receive a new glorified resurrected body. But that's not for everybody. We can't look at a battlefield of soldiers and say, "Hey, no big deal. All these people are coming back. All these people are just changing clothes. No big deal if they just transitioned a little sooner rather than later." No, no, we need to understand that death is serious.\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tYeah. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tThey teach that the thing that brings you back is that when you die, all of your desire and all of your emotion and all of your love and hate and feelings lives on after and goes into the next body. But what does the Bible teach? The Bible says in verse 4 of Ecclesiastes 9. \r\n\r\nPaul:\t"For to him that's joined to all the living, there is hope. For a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they shall die, but the dead know not anything. Neither have they anymore reward for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished. Neither have they anymore apportion forever in anything that is done under the sun." \r\n\r\nPastor:\tThey're never coming back. They're done. Even their emotions die with them, the Bible teaches. \r\n\r\nBut number three, according to the Bhagavad Gita, the entire goal of our lives, the entire goal of our existence, why we're even here, is self-realization. Okay, this just comes up over and over again on scores of pages in this book. Self-realization, that's our goal according to this. Now let me read for you some of the excerpts from this book right here, the Bhagavad Gita, about the self. I'm just going to pick a few things because there are so many places in here that talk about these things. \r\n\r\nNarrator 6:\tThey are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and self-realization. In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the self reveals itself. Beholding the self by means of the self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. The practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the path of yoga. Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within. Train it to rest in the self.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tThis is what meditation is all about. This is what yoga is about. Hinduism teaches us to worship the self, which they call in Sanskrit the Atman. And they basically teach that the self is God. That the Atman is God. Well, the Bible says, "He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool." We shouldn't look within to find God. We need to look outside ourselves to find God because guess what? You're not God.\r\n\r\nIf you go to Isaiah chapter 14, you'll see that it's actually Satan who teaches us that we can be as gods or liken to God. Now this goes all the way back to the garden of Eden where the devil comes, the serpent comes in Genesis 3 and what does he say? "You shall be as gods if you eat of this forbidden fruit, if you commit this sin." He says, "You shall be of gods knowing good and evil." That was the temptation.\r\n\r\nWell, in Isaiah chapter 14 we see where Lucifer wanted to be like god. \r\n\r\nPaul:\t"How art thou falleth from heaven, O, Lucifer. Son of the morning. How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weakened the nations? For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit." \r\n\r\nPastor:\tSo, it's Lucifer who wants to be like the most high. And even, in the beginning, he's tempting them. "You shall be as gods." So, this idea that you're god or that you become god or that you will merge with god, this is satanic teaching. It's demonic. It's of the devil.\r\n\r\nNarrator 5:\tThere is an end to the cycle of death and rebirth. It's called Moksha. It's reached by always trying to be the best we can be. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 15:\tif you get to Moksha, you will be one with god. And you feel really good. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 16:\tIt just tells me that I should always do good and I'll improve. And my next life will be better.\r\n\r\nSpeaker 17:\tWe believe in rebirth and reincarnation. And eventually, once we have become perfected, we'll achieve Moksha where we'll merge with god. Our soul is essentially one with Brahman already. We just don't know it yet. We have this veil of maya or illusion, which gives us the idea that we're separate from God. Once we have achieved enlightenment, then we will merge with God like a drop of water into the ocean. Since we are essentially God ask yourself, why are you here? \r\n\r\nSpeaker 18:\tBecause it's fun.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tI mean, look, I don't see how anybody could read this book and walk away with any other conclusion than "I'm God." When I read this book, and if I actually believed in this garbage and didn't believe in the Word of God and wasn't anchored in the Holy Bible, I would walk away from this book saying, "I'm God."\r\n\r\nNarrator 7:\tOther Hindu scriptures, such as the Upanishads, teach the exact same thing that "You are the self and that the self is God." For example, here in the Mandaka Upanishad, part three verse two, "As long as we think we are the ego, we feel attached and fall into sorrow. But realize that you are the self, the Lord of life, and you will be freed from sorrow. When you realize that you are the self, supreme source of life, supreme source of love, you transcend the duality of life and enter into the unitive state." \r\n\r\nSo, notice, he's telling us to realize that we are the lord of life. We are the supreme source of light, supreme source of love. Once you realize that you are the self and that you are the lord, you'll reach the unitive state, which is referred to unity with God. Notice, here, on another page, the self is not someone other than you. It says over and over again. The self is not someone other than you. But then over and over again, the self is related to their God.\r\n\r\nAlso, here in this Upanishad it says, "Those who deny the lord deny themselves. Those who affirm the lord, affirm themselves." And over and over again, you'll find this teaching in the Upanishads that you are the self and that the self is god. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tI am not God. I am not going to become like God. I am not going to merge with God. You say, "Well, it's obscure teaching." But here's the thing. Even branches of Christianity have become influenced by this false teaching of Hinduism, most notably the Orthodox Church. And listen, don't fall for this lie that Russian Orthodox Church isn't that bad. Or that Romanian Orthodox or Coptic Orthodox, that it isn't that bad. A lot of people are being sucked into this now. And listen to me: the Orthodox Church has a lot in common with Roman Catholicism, but they have one doctrine that's even weirder than Roman Catholicism. They have a doctrine in the Orthodox Church called theosis or deification where you can become deified, you can merge with God and basically become like unto God.\r\n\r\nNarrator 3:\tGod became man that men may become Gods. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 19:\tSection 460 of the Catechism is a beautiful synopsis of what the Church teaches by deification. That Jesus became human so we could become gods.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tIn fact, one of their saints that they look to as their spiritual forefather St. Athanasius said this, "God became man so that man might become gods." That's what the church father ... The Church fathers, what are they? I don't care what the so-called Church fathers say because the Bible says not to call any man upon this earth Father. \r\n\r\nCongregation:\tYeah. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tBut people in the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, they look to these so-called Church fathers instead of scripture. All I care about is what this book says, but the Church father St. Athanasius said, "Well, God became a man so that man might become gods." That is a blasphemous statement and I don't care how you sugarcoat that or what context you put that in, that's blasphemy. Men do not become gods. And we do not merge with God. We do not become deified through theosis. That is a very bad false religion orthodoxy. Don't sugarcoat it and say, "Oh, it's not that bad. It's sort of halfway Protestant or Baptist." No, it isn't. \r\n\r\nThe last point that I want to make tonight is that according to this false scripture of Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita, it says basically that as long as you do good works you'll be fine. So, it gives a false hope that as long as you do good deeds in your life you're going to be okay. You might not make nirvana this time around, but you'll be okay.\r\n\r\nNarrator 6:\t"Krishna, what happens to one who has faith but who lacks self-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in yoga? Arjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end either here or in the world to come. When such people die, they go to other realms where the righteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are reborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. Or they may be born into a family where meditation is practiced. To be born into such a family is extremely rare. The wisdom they have acquired in previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive even harder for self-realization."\r\n\r\nPastor:\tSo, what is he teaching? Hey, as long as you do good work, you're fine. No harm's going to befall you. Don't stress about it. Don't worry about it. Just do good works, do your best. And isn't this what people in America think? Hey, just do good, do good works, and on Judgment Day you're going to be fine. You're going to Heaven for a little while and kind of benefit from some good karma. Then you're going to be born into a really happy prosperous home. You might even be lucky enough to be born into a home where your parents are hippies who are into meditating. I mean that'd be really good for you. Or Hindu or whatever home. \r\n\r\nBut does the Bible teach that as long as you do good deeds and good works there's nothing to worry about? Is that what the Bible teaches? No, the Bible actually says in Matthew 7, "Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have we not cast out devil? And in thy name done many wonderful works?' And then will I profess unto them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me ye that work in equity.'" You see, if Jesus Christ doesn't know you and your name's not in that Book of Life, you're doomed. \r\n\r\nCongregation:\tYep. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tThe Bible says, "He that believeth not is condemned already." And the context is believing on the Son of God. It says, "He that believeth not is condemned already" because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. No matter how much good work you do, if you have not believed in the Name of the Son of God, you're doomed, you're damned. \r\n\r\nSo, we need to realize that the Hindus are not saved. They're not Christian. Even sometimes, they'll even say, like, "Well, we also believe in Christ also." So, sometimes you'll run into people who think that they can be Christian and Hindu, that we're all worshiping the same God. No, my friend. Make no mistake about it. This is of the devil. This is demonic. This is evil. \r\n\r\nThat's why I don't want anything to do with its teachings or philosophies. I don't want to quote Gandhi on spiritual things. I don't want to do yoga. I don't want to talk about things from a Hindu perspective. Through Star Wars and other movies and TV shows a lot of this mysticism becomes a part of who we are. We grew up with the teachings of Hinduism, whether we know it or not of anger, hatred, this is the path to the dark side. \r\n\r\nStar Wars 1:\tHow feel you?\r\n\r\nStar Wars 2:\tCold, sir.\r\n\r\nStar Wars 1:\tAfraid, are you?\r\n\r\nStar Wars 2:\tNo, sir. \r\n\r\nStar Wars 1:\tSee through you we can.\r\n\r\nStar Wars 3:\tBe mindful of your feelings.\r\n\r\nStar Wars 4:\tYour thoughts dwell on your mother. \r\n\r\nStar Wars 2:\tI miss her.\r\n\r\nStar Wars 1:\tAfraid to lose her, I think, hmm?\r\n\r\nStar Wars 2:\tWhat does that got to do with anything?\r\n\r\nStar Wars 1:\tEverything. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tThis stuff is all just lifted from eastern mysticism straight into pop culture. And it becomes a part of people's beliefs. The Jedi, if you look at what they're saying, it's Buddhism and Hinduism, which are by the way very similar to one another. \r\n\r\nWe need to make sure that all of our philosophies, opinions, political ideas, religious ideas, cultural ideas, everything that we believe should come from this book. Why? Because a lot of what we think of as worldly philosophy, worldly wisdom, the wisdom of this world, it actually came from somewhere. Where the worldly stuff come from? I'll tell you, a lot of it came from whether you realize it or not, it came out of Hinduism and it came out of Buddhism. It came out of eastern mysticism and falsehood. \r\n\r\nA lot of weird stuff in the Catholic Church came out of Hinduism. It came out of Buddhism. And I proved that in my sermon on Catholicism and Buddhism where I showed all the similarities where they're borrowing from the Buddhists. And we need to make sure that we get all of our beliefs about everything from the Bible. Why? Because we're constantly being bombarded with quote worldly philosophies, which really are the philosophies of the devil. Because if they're coming from Hinduism, they're coming from the devil.\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tYeah.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tThey're coming from the cosmic serpent. Right? They're coming from the god of death and the lord of the snakes. That's where they're coming from. \r\n\r\nBut not only that, I'm hoping that as you hear this sermon, you will be stirred up in your heart to want to reach Hindus with the Gospel. \r\n\r\nCongregation:\tAmen.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tBecause these people are blinded. They're born into this. It's not like they all just chose to just go worship Satan. No, they're born into this false religion. They're taught this from the time they grow up. They are blinded. They are deceived. And you know, Joel Osteen said, hey, they are really nice, kind people. I'm sure they are. I'm sure they are very peaceful, nice, kind people, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. And someone needs to bring them the Gospel and shine the light of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ so that they might be saved, but if our Gospel be hid, it's them that are lost. And whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not.\r\n\r\nOne of the cool things about soul winning in the Caribbean is that you've got people that are Muslims, you've got people that are Hindus, but they're usually always willing to listen to the Gospel. And because they are willing to listen to the Gospel, we were able to get some Hindus saved. We were able to get some Muslims saved. Look, the Hindus can be saved. The Word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword has power to save. So, even in these last days, we can see a great harvest of souls coming for the Lord.\r\n\r\nThink about India today. It's predominantly Hindu, especially in northern India, but look, I believe that in the last days leading up to the second Coming of Christ, I believe we can win Hindus to the Lord here in the Caribbean. And I believe that we will go to India someday and win Hindus to the Lord in India itself. And I believe that great exploits can be done, that one billion Hindus can hear the Gospel.\r\n\r\nYou say, "Well, I just don't know a special presentation for Hindu." Look, you don't need a special presentation of the Gospel for each religion. You know the same Gospel saves everybody? You know, you can just through that show them that they're a sinner, and show them Hell, and show them the life of Christ and his death, burial and resurrection, and show them that it's a free gift, and show them that it's by faith. And maybe some of the things that you heard in this sermon might show you a few things that you might want to point out to them at the end of your Gospel presentation. \r\n\r\nBut I always start out by giving everybody the Gospel the same way. Instead of getting all complicated, why don't you give them the Gospel? Because you know what? It's the power of God and the salvation to everyone that believe it. To the Jew first and also the Greek. And also the Hindu. That Gospel of the death, burial and resurrection of Christ is the power of God. No matter who you're telling it to.\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tAmen.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tSo, you don't have to show up with some customized Hindu plan of salvation. No, you just show up and you give the plan of salvation. But then at the end of the plan of salvation, once you've gone through the whole Gospel and made it plain, then at the end maybe you can just emphasize that "Wait a minute, all of the faith has to be on Jesus. You have to renounce these other gods. You have to renounce other gods that you're worshiping and acknowledge that this is the true God. Jesus."\r\n\r\nNow a lot of people think that they're going to Heaven because of how good they are. If we go around and ask people, "Do you know for sure if you die today you'll go to Heaven?" A lot of them would say, "Yes, because I'm a good person" or "Yes because I keep the Commandments" or "Yes, I live a good life." But that's not what the Bible says. \r\n\r\nThe Bible actually says that we're not saved by our good deeds or our good life. It says that we're saved by the Gospel, which is the death, burial and resurrection of Christ. The reason why it's important to understand that we're not saved by how good we are, the Bible says in Romans 3:10, as it is written, "There is none righteous. No not one." So, none of us is righteous. I'm not righteous, you're not righteous. And the Bible says, "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God." Every single one of us has sinned before and because of that sin we come short of the glory of God. \r\n\r\nThe Bible says there is a punishment for our sin. It says for the wages of sin is death, but not only are we going to die physically one day, the Bible talks about a second death. It says, "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." Now what would we normally call that lake of fire? What would we refer to that as?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tHell.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tRight. And the Bible actually has a list of people that are going to Hell. It says the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and sorcerers and whoremongers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. \r\n\r\nNow this doesn't really look like a room full of murderers to me. I don't see a lot of murderers. Probably not a lot of sorcerers. Anybody in here into black magic and witchcraft? Probably not. So, you may not be a sorcerer or a murderer or anything like that, but you know what the Bible does say, "And all liars." I know I've lied before. Who here has lied before? Yeah, every single person. The Bible says, "Ye let God be true, but every man a liar." Unfortunately, we've all committed that sin. We've all lied before. But the Bible said, "All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." So, according to the Bible, that's where we all deserve to go, to the second death, to the lake of fire because we've all sinned, we've all lied. \r\n\r\nLet's be honest, we've done other sins too. There are times where we've disobeyed our parents, which is a sin. There are times where we may have stolen something. Or even the Bible says, just the thought of foolishness is sin. Even just thinking a stupid thoughts and we have thousands of thoughts every day. I'm sure many of them are foolish. I'm sure many of them are stupid.\r\n\r\nSo, we've all sinned, but the good news is that God loves us. And if God loves us, of course, He does not want us to go to Hell. But was he just kidding when he said that the lake of fire is where we're going if we've lied? No, that's no joke, but that's why Jesus Christ came to this earth to save us. The Bible says, "But God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." And Jesus Christ was God in the form of a human being, right? Because there's the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. And so, God himself came down to this earth in the form of a human being. He was born as a little baby, born of a virgin, and he was just a little baby. And he grew up and he lived a perfect life. He never sinned one time. He was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin. \r\n\r\nNow Jesus performed a lot of miracles, didn't he? Does anybody remember some of the miracles that Jesus performed? Anybody remember one? Your hand popped up. Who's got one?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\t[inaudible 00:48:38].\r\n\r\nPastor:\tYes, there was a deaf man that he healed. What else did he do?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\t[inaudible 00:48:41].\r\n\r\nPastor:\tHe healed a blind man. \r\n\r\nCongregation:\t[inaudible 00:48:44] turned water into wine.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tHe turned water into wine. Great. Anybody else got one?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tHe raised Lazarus.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tHe raised Lazarus from the dead. Wait, did she take yours? Anybody else got one? What about when he fed 5000 people with five loaves and two fishes. You remember that? He did a lot of miracles. What about when Peter, remember his disciple Peter, actually whipped out a sword in the garden of Gethsemane. And Peter swung a sword and chopped off one of the servants of the high priest's ear, and Jesus picked up the guy's ear and put it back on and healed it, right? You remember that story?\r\n\r\nSo, Jesus performed a lot of miracles, but he also preached the Word of God. He also preached the Truth. And a lot of people are offended by the Truth. They get angry when they hear about the Truth. When they hear the Bible preach, it offends people, it angers people sometimes. And so, Jesus had a lot of enemies. \r\n\r\nSo, eventually, Jesus got arrested and they arrested Jesus at night, and they took him down at night, and they actually put him on trial and then they beat him. They spit on him, they hit him in the head with a stick, and they also whipped him. And after that they nailed him on to the cross. And the Bible says that when Jesus was nailed to that cross, that he himself bear our sins in his own body on the tree. That means that every sin that you've ever done and every sin that I've ever done, it was as if Jesus had done it. He was basically being punished for our sins. And then, after Jesus died on the cross, they buried his body in a tomb of a rich man named Joseph of Aramathea. They put him in that tomb and put a big, giant stone over the door of where his body was laid. And his soul went down into Hell for three days and three nights, and three days later what happened?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\t[inaudible 00:50:32].\r\n\r\nPastor:\tHe rose again from the dead, right? And when Jesus rose again from the dead, he showed the disciples the holes in his hands and the holes in his side just to prove that it was really him. Now Jesus died for everybody in this whole world, but everybody's not automatically going to go to Heaven because the Bible's teaching that there's one thing that we must do to be saved. And it asked this question one time is "What must I do to be saved?" And they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." And that's it. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved. \r\n\r\nSo, it does not say that you have to join my Church to be saved. It doesn't say join your Church to be saved. It doesn't say to join any Church to be saved. Church is important, Church is good, but when it comes to being saved, the one thing that we must do to be saved is believe on Lord Jesus Christ in order to be saved. \r\n\r\nNow, there are lots of things that we should do, right? What are some things that we should do? I mean, we should read our Bibles. We should pray. We should go to Church. We should keep the Commandments. We should do a lot. We should be a good student at school. We should obey our parents, obey the teacher. Those are all good things that we should do. But when it comes to what we must do, what we must do to be saved is one thing: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved. \r\n\r\nSee, John 3:16 says that, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever, whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life." So, notice it doesn't say whoever's good enough. It doesn't say stops any ... it says whoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life. The Bible says, "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it's the gift of God. Not of works lest any man should boast." So, salvation is the gift of God.\r\n\r\nLet me ask you this. If I were to give you a gift today, would you have to give me money for that if I'm giving you a gift?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tNo.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tYou're going like this, but now you're going like this. All right. Yeah, if somebody gives you a gift, it's free. If I said, "Hey," what's your name?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tHakim.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tHakim? If I said, "Hey, I'm going to give you this Bible as a gift, Hakim, but you got to give me $5000." Is that a gift? What if I said, "Okay, Hakim, I got this Bible for you. It's a free gift, but my car's outside. I need you to clean it out and wash it and then I'll give it to you." Is that a gift?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tNo.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tWhat if I said to you, "Hey Hakim, I'm going to give you this Bible as a gift, but you're going to be my servant for the rest of your life, so you have to obey everything, whatever I tell you." Is that a gift?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tNo.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tNo way. Okay, what if I said, "Here, Hakim, I'm going to give you this Bible as a gift. It's yours for free." And then I came back two weeks later, and I come in to class, I say, "Hey Hakim, I need that back." Is that a gift?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tNo.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tno. The thing about a gift is that a gift is free and once you receive it, it's yours forever. You get to keep it, right? So, let me ask you this, if God gives us the gift of eternal life, is he going to come back and take it away from us?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tNo. \r\n\r\nPastor:\tIs he going to break his promise and take it away? The Bible says this is the promise that he had promised us even eternal life. So, if God promised us eternal life, is he going to break his promise and take it away from us? So, once he gives you that gift it's yours. \r\n\r\nThat's why the Gospel's called Good News because that's good news. The good news is that it's easy to go to Heaven. You think a loving God would want to make it hard to go to Heaven or easy to go to Heaven? If he loves us, right, it's easy. He wants us to be saved. He did the hard part when he died for us. That was the hard part, being crucified, being buried, rising again. All we have to do is believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, it's that easy to be saved. \r\n\r\nAnd then once we receive that free gift of eternal life, there's nothing we can ever do to lose that because Jesus promised us, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Jesus said, "I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." Once we're saved, we have eternal life for God's children. He will never leave us or forsake us.\r\n\r\nNow if we go out and break the Commandments after we're saved, we're still saved but he will punish us on this earth. You will reap what you sow. What goes around comes around. And just as your parents will discipline you when you disobey, they'll punish you, but they're not going to throw you out of the family, are they? I mean, if you break a rule at your house ... Tell me a rule that's in your house. What's one of the rules at your house.\r\n\r\nCongregation:\t[inaudible 00:54:58].\r\n\r\nPastor:\tThere's no running in the hallway. Okay, and what's your name? Kelly?\r\n\r\nCongregation:\tI'm Kellyanne.\r\n\r\nPastor:\tKellyanne? So, let's say Kellyanne goes home today and just starts running through the hallway, just running through the hallway, just running up and down the house, do you think her parents are going to say, "You know, Kellyanne, you can't be our daughter anymore. You must leave home. We cannot have a daughter like you in our house. We're sending you away." Do you think that would happen?\r\n\r\nOkay, but do you think they're just going to smile and say it's okay? "Just keep on running, Kellyanne." Do you think they're just going to be like a pit crew, giving her water and a Gatorade and tell her to keep running? No, they're going to make her stop, right? They're going to discipline her and say, "Hey, you break the rules, you're going to be punished." But they're not going to throw her out of the family. Over here, it's the same thing with God. If we break God's rules, he'll punish us on this earth, but he's not going to kick us out of the family. Okay. \r\n\r\nThat's probably a small rule. There's probably other bigger rules where she'll get a bigger punishment. So, let's say she breaks a huge rule, she's going to get a huge punishment. If she breaks a little rule, she's going to get a little punishment, but no matter what she does, she's still going to be their daughter. They're still going to love her, right? They're still going to give her food and a place to sleep. It's the same way with God. Once we believe on Jesus Christ, we're his children. He'll never leave us. He'll never forsake us. If we break the rules, he'll discipline us, but he's not going to throw us out of the family. \r\n\r\nDoes everybody understand what I'm saying today? Who believes what I'm saying today? You believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose again and that you're saved by believing in Christ, who believes that? Okay, well listen, I want to pray with you real quick before I go, okay? I'm just about done. I just want to pray with you and help you to tell God that that's what you believe right now and just confess that to God right now. Let's bow our heads and pray. You can just repeat this after me and say this to God. \r\n\r\nDear Jesus, I know that I'm a sinner. I know I deserve Hell, but thank you for dying on the cross for me, and rising again from the dead. Please save me right now and give me the gift of eternal life. I'm only trusting you, Jesus. Your death, your burial and your resurrection. Amen. \r\n\r\nNow who just prayed that prayer right now and you meant it? Put up your hand if you meant that. Yeah. So, here's the thing, here's what the Bible had said. It said that "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth to Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from dead thou shalt be saved." He didn't say you might be saved. He said you shall be saved. Isn't that great news? So, you already know the last chapter in your life. You already know that you're going to Heaven when you die, but the question is how you're going to live your life in between, right? Do you want to just keep getting disciplined, like if Kellyanne just ran through the hall everyday? Do you want to keep getting disciplined or do you want God to bless you and please God and you want to love God and show him your love by obeying his commandments?

The "land of the free" has now become the land of the enslaved. The people of our once glorious United States have traded their liberty for security. But has it all happened by design? \r\n\r\nDr. Roland Rasmussen: Many questions linger about the events of that day - that day of infamy. But one thing we know for certain: the surprise attack on pearl harbor set in motion a course of events that would eventually lead us to a one world government. \r\n\r\nDr. Roland Rasmussen: In the aftermath of World War 2, the United Nations was created, and the path toward a one world government accelerated. Each war brings us one step closer to what the Bible calls "the end of the world." Checkpoints are being set up everywhere; the police state is tightening its grip on the people of the United States, and to those who understand biblical prophecy, what comes next will not be a surprise. \r\n\r\nDr. Roland Rasmussen: At some time in the future, the King James Bible states that everyone on the planet will be required to take a mark in order to buy or sell. As our current economic system collapses, and as technology expands, cash is becoming a thing of the past. The reality of a cashless society is not far off. In fact, it's already being implemented. Despite denials by many religious leaders, evil men are working around the clock to bring in a New World Order. We can see the end rapidly approaching, and the stage being set for the emergence of the antichrist. We can hear the voices of those who are subverting our US Constitution and promoting this global government system. And with all this right around the corner, this film is more important than ever. Satan is working behind the scenes to set up a one world government and a one world religion in preparation for the antichrist. He has also deceived modern evangelical Christians into believing that they will be removed from this earth before the Great Tribulation takes place. This doctrine, known as the "pre-tribulation rapture," teaches that Christ may return at any moment, and that there will be no signs of his coming. As a result of this deception, most Christians are completely unprepared for what the Bible has warned us is coming. Although the scriptures clearly state in Matthew 24, and elsewhere, that the rapture will take place AFTER THE TRIBULATION, big name preachers, Bible colleges, and popular films such as Left Behind have taught the masses to expect that the rapture may occur at any moment. And because most Christians have never read the entire Bible for themselves, few are aware that the pre-trib rapture is a fraud not found in scripture. But if the pre-tribulation rapture is not found in scripture, where did it come from? \r\n\r\nScene 1 - Characters \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: My name is Steven Anderson, and I am the pastor of Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona, and I am on a mission to educate people about the pre-tribulation rapture because it is a position that is based upon ignorance, and I just believe that if people would see the scriptures and see the facts, it would not be hard for them to come to the conclusion that the rapture definitely comes AFTER THE TRIBULATION. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: My name is Roger Jimenez. I am the pastor at Verity Baptist Church in Sacramento, California. I grew up in a Christian home, and I was taught the pre-tribulation rapture my whole life, and I never had a reason to question it. Preachers told us that, and I just took it for what it was worth, but as I was exposed to that doctrine, I began to see just how unscriptural it really was, and I just feel that we need to teach the Bible and get the truth out there. \r\n\r\nScene 2 - History \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: The pre-tribulation rapture doctrine is pretty new. There is no evidence of anyone teaching it before 1830. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: We have to understand that the 1830s is pretty late in history. For thousands of years from the time of Christ, we went through the reformation, we went through all sorts of theologians - whatever you do or don't agree with men like Martin Luther, or John Calvin, or whoever, the fact is that thousands of books, thousands of papers, thousands of essays, and a whole lot of preaching had been done before 1830, \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: And I am saying there is no evidence of anyone from any denomination, any type of Christianity, that taught this doctrine. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: When you look at the historical account, you have to ask yourself the question, "What are the roots of the pre-tribulation rapture?" \r\n\r\nDr. Roland Rasmussen: One of the early proponents of pre-tribulationism was a man by the name of John Nelson Darby. In the 1830s, he began to teach the doctrine of what he called "the Secret Rapture." He would later produce his own translation of the Bible from which he removed entire verses, corrupted important Biblical doctrines, and tampered with key passages concerning the second coming of Jesus Christ. John Nelson Darby, known as "the Father of Modern Dispensationalism," promoted his theory of a pre-tribulation rapture throughout the nineteenth century. Later the pre-tribulation rapture gained widespread acceptance among Baptists when Oxford University Press published the Scofield Reference Bible, which contained marginal notes promoting the concept of Darby's secret rapture. These notes have caused many Christians to embrace this doctrine as though God had said it himself. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: The Devil has used this tool of the Scofield Reference System of the Bible more than anything to promote this doctrine of the pre-trib rapture. You want to know where it comes from? This is how it got into churches. This is where pastors are getting it. It is not coming from the Bible. It sure did not come from the mouth of Jesus Christ! But it came from the mouth of Scofield. Scofield's notes point to a pre-tribulation rapture, and they lead the reader to believe that it is in scripture when it is really not there at all. So because of the Scofield Bible being sent out to so many seminaries and colleges, and so many young preacher boys reading the Scofield Reference Bible, they started to just take the pre-tribulation rapture as fact and started preaching it. \r\n\r\nDr. Roland Rasmussen: Fictionalizations about the imminent rapture also reached the seventies generation through the films of Don Thompson. \r\n\r\nDr. Roland Rasmussen: Thompson's trilogy of thrillers played a significant role in indoctrinating a new generation of teens. Since its premier, more than 300 million have seen "A Thief in the Night." In 1995, Tim Dalehouse published Tim LaHaye's and Jerry Jenkins' apocalyptic novel "Left Behind." \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: This is a fictional series that depicts everybody disappearing, and nobody knows where they are. Cars are crashing into each other; airplanes are crashing because the pilot is gone, and this dramatic presentation of the pre-tribulation rapture has become a part of the American culture, and people just accept it to be true, and … it's a stupid movie. \r\n\r\nDr. Roland Rasmussen: Left Behind would go on to sell 63 million copies worldwide, spawn a series of 16 books, as well as three movie adaptations to date. But Left Behind is a work of fiction. To learn the truth about the rapture, we must look within the pages of the Bible itself. \r\n\r\nScene 3 - 1 Thessalonians 4 and Matthew 24 \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 is the key rapture passage. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: And in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, we find probably the most famous text regarding the rapture. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Anyone would agree that this passage is talking about the rapture. This is the most clear teaching in the Bible about Jesus coming in the clouds, and us being caught up together to meet him. The Bible reads in verse 13: \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 4:13) "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope." \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 4:14) "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him." \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So, what he is saying here is that he does not want them to be ignorant about Christians, believers who have died, those who are asleep in Jesus, those who have already gone on to be with the Lord. He says, I don't want you to be ignorant of this brethren because I don't want you to mourn like those who have no hope. I want you to know that you will see your loved one again that was a saved person. You are going to see them once again because the Bible says that when Jesus Christ comes back, he will bring them with him. The dead in Christ shall rise first, and so forth. That is why he said in verse 18: \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 4:18) Wherefore comfort one another with these words. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: That is why this is a really popular passage you will hear at funerals. I have been to a lot of funerals where people comfort one another with these words. So notice, in every single verse, he is bringing up the fact that we will see these people again who have passed on. \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 4:15) For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent [come before] them which are asleep. \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 4:16) For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 4:17) Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 4:18) Wherefore comfort one another with these words. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So if you get the context, the comfort is that you will see your loved ones again. He says, You will see them again because if you believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so (in the same way), them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. They are going to be resurrected. The dead in Christ shall rise first. He says, Comfort one another with these words. There is no comfort here mentioned that you will escape persecution. You are not going to be persecuted. You are not going to go through tribulation. You are not going to go through affliction. You are not going to suffer. Does this passage even mention the tribulation? Was anything about the tribulation mentioned? No. He did not say, Comfort one another that you will not go through tribulation. Comfort one another that you will not be persecuted. Comfort one another that there is a pre-tribulation rapture. That is not what he is saying! \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: Now when we look at this passage, there are a few characteristics that we can see about the rapture which will help us identify the rapture in other passages. I would like you to understand what the rapture consists of. If you look at verse number 16 there, it says, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven…" So the first thing we need to understand about the rapture is that the Lord is coming down from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel, and I want you to take notice of this, "and with the trump of God." That is the second characteristic I would like you to see about the rapture. The Lord will descend, there will be the trump of God, and then the Bible says, "The dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be…" Take note of these words: "caught up together with them in the clouds…" So when the rapture happens, according to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, the characteristics of the rapture are: \r\n\r\n1. Lord Descends 2. Trumpet Sounds 3. Caught up in the Clouds \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: We will be caught up together to meet him in the clouds. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Go back to Matthew 24 and see the exact same elements in Matthew 24:29-31. Look at Matthew 24:29, "Immediately after the tribulation of those days," and sometimes I want to just ask people, "What part of AFTER do you not understand about this passage?" But it says: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:29) Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:30) And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man [The "Son of Man" is something that Jesus called himself while he was on this earth] coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:31) And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: All the same elements! Jesus is coming in the clouds. A trumpet sounds. He sends the angels to gather his elect. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: The reason I showed you this is that I wanted you to understand that in Matthew 24:29-31, we see the rapture, and when we compare it to 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, it matches up perfectly. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Keep your finger there, and go to Mark 13. Now Mark 13 pretty much says all the same things Matthew 24 says. It is what we would call a "parallel passage." You will find the same preaching, the same teaching in these two passages. You can put them side by side. They say the same things. Let me show it to you in that passage. It says in verse 24: \r\n\r\n(Mark 13:24) But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, \r\n\r\n(Mark 13:25) And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. \r\n\r\n(Mark 13:26) And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. \r\n\r\n(Mark 13:27) And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Now at this point we could just pray and go home. We should just be able to close our Bible, and say, "There you have it, folks. It is AFTER THE TRIBULATION," and just close our Bibles and go home. But oh no, we are not going to close our Bibles and go home because I am going to prove to you and show you that this is talking about the rapture, and that this says it is AFTER THE TRIBULATION. \r\n\r\nScene 4 - Matthew 24 is not speaking only to "the Jews" \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: A lot of people will attack this chapter and say, "You can't get your doctrine on this from Matthew 24 because Matthew 24 is only talking to the Jews." They will just write this passage off, and say, "Oh, this is only for the Jews." And some scholar somewhere decided that the book of Matthew is to the Jews, the book of Mark is to the Romans, the book of Luke is to the Greeks, and the book of John is to the world. Oh, thank you, God, for including us in at least one of the four gospels! But who comes up with this stuff? Maybe Matthew is geared toward the Jews. Maybe Luke is geared toward the Greeks. Maybe the epistle of Paul to the Ephesians was geared toward the Ephesians. Do you think? Maybe the epistle of Paul to the Hebrews was geared toward the Hebrews. Maybe the epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians was geared toward the Thessalonians, but every promise in the book is mine! Every chapter, every verse, every line! The book of Titus was not just for Titus! That was a short-lived book! It is for every pastor to read. It is for every believer to read. It is the New Testament! \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: But here is what they will say, "No, Pastor Anderson, you don't get it. This whole sermon was preached about the Jews, to the Jews, for the Jews. Jesus Christ was preaching to the Jews in the Olivet Discourse (the fancy theological name they give this passage). Pastor Anderson, he was talking to the Jews! Don't you get it! When he said in Mark 13:24, After that tribulation, and then he talked about Jesus coming in the clouds in verse 26, and gathering the elect in verse 27, from the uttermost part of the earth, to the uttermost part of heaven, that is just talking to the Jews only." Okay, look at the last verse of Mark 13: And what I say unto you, I'm only saying to the Jews. Don't let any preacher try and tell you this is for all believers. It's only for the Jews. Is that what it says in Mark 13:37. No! It says: \r\n\r\n(Mark 13:37) And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: That is the last word of the chapter. \r\n\r\n(Mark 13:37) And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: And yet people will still turn around and say, "This chapter is not talking to all. It is only talking to the Jews." It is almost like he knew that people would say that, so he just says it at the end. I am not just talking to you. I am talking to all when I say, Watch. This is for everybody. To say that this chapter is only talking to the Jews is ridiculous when he flat out says: \r\n\r\n(Mark 13:37) And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: Oftentimes people will look at Matthew 24:30-31, and they will say, "Well, even though it looks like the rapture, and even though it sounds like the rapture, it is not the rapture," and here is the reason that they will say it is not the rapture. If you look at verse 31, it says, "And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect…" and people will look at that word, and they will say, "See there, the word 'elect' is not Christians." They will say, "The 'elect' is Israel. Therefore Matthew 24 is not the rapture. It is not meant for Christians. This whole chapter is meant for the Jews because he is talking about the elect." The issue with that is this: we must always allow the Bible to be its own dictionary. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: I have a list here of every time the word "elect" is used. We are not going to go though it because we do not have time, but I could go through every time "elect" is used, and I could show you that every single time, it is talking about people that are saved. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: The reason people think that word "elect" is talking about "Jews," or talking about "Israel," is that instead of studying the Bible, and instead of reading the Bible, they have been reading commentaries, and they have been reading books written by men, and those men have told them what the definition of "elect" is. The Scofield Reference Bible has a note in Matthew 24 saying that the word "elect" is referring to "Israel." But the Bible defines itself, and the Bible gives us the answer to all the questions of doctrine we have, and the word "elect," if you study it out in the Bible, simply is not the Jew. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Just to give you a quick highlight, in 1 Thessalonians 1:4, it says: \r\n\r\n(1 Thessalonians 1:4) Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: ...talking to the Thessalonians who were clearly Gentiles. We saw it in Romans 8: \r\n\r\n(Romans 8:33) Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Out of 16 mentions of the term "elect" in the Bible, I found 10 refer to all believers in general, two of them refer to believers who are specifically Gentiles, one of them refers to believers who are Jews, two of them refer to Jesus Christ himself, and one of them refers to Jacob, the person, as being God's elect. I will give you one verse that clearly shows that the elect does not mean "Israel" because people say, "The elect? That is Israel. That is the Jews." \r\n\r\n(Romans 11:7) What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So the Bible says, Israel has not; the election has. Well, if Israel were the election, that would not make any sense. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: Throughout scripture it is very clear, if you allow the Bible to define itself, that the "elect" are not the Jews, that the "elect" is not the nation of Israel, the elect are believers. They can be from Asia minor; they can be Greek; they can be barbarians; they can be whatever. If you have put on Christ, if you have put on the new man, you are considered the elect. So when we go back to Matthew 24, and he says, "And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect," that goes perfectly with the passage, in regard to the fact that it is the rapture of believers. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: It has nothing to do with whether they are a Jew or a Gentile, black or white. The elect are those that are saved. He is going to gather them up in the clouds with him. Now isn't that completely consistent with what it said in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4? When it said that there is going to be a trumpet, and that the believers will be caught up to be with Christ. A little later on in the same chapter, it says, "But of that day and hour knoweth no man..." so no one knows the day or the hour when this will happen. I cannot tell you, "This will happen on October xx of this year." Also, later on, he says: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:40) Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:41) Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:42) Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So God is telling us that we do not know when it will be. It is something to watch for. We do not know the day or the hour, but he does tell us that it is AFTER THE TRIBULATION because he said that AFTER THE TRIBULATION the sun and moon are darkened, then Jesus Christ comes in the clouds. That is when the trumpet sounds. That is when the believers are caught up. So just because we do not know the day or the hour, does not mean that this is something that could happen at any moment. A lot of people will look at that "no man knoweth the day or the hour," and say, "It could happen at any moment." Well, he just finished saying that it is AFTER THE TRIBULATION. This is actually found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Matthew covers it in chapter 24, Mark covers it in chapter 13, Luke covers it in chapter 17 and chapter 21, and then John covers it in the book of Revelation. It is covered by all four. First comes the tribulation, then the sun and moon are darkened, then Jesus comes in the clouds at the rapture. \r\n\r\nScene 5 - "Tribulation" does NOT mean "wrath" \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: The reason that people think that the rapture is before the tribulation is that they confuse the tribulation with God's wrath. One way to prove that God's wrath and the tribulation are two completely different things is that in Matthew 24:29, it says, "Immediately AFTER THE TRIBULATION of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give here light." So the Bible is very clear in Matthew 24 that the sun and moon are darkened AFTER THE TRIBULATION. Well, then if you go to Revelation 6 where you read about when the sun and moon are darkened (when the 6th seal is opened), it says, "...and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood" - exactly what it said in Matthew 24. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 6:13) And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 6:14) And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 6:15) And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; \r\n\r\n(Revelation 6:16) And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 6:17) For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So, according to this, when does God's wrath begin to be poured out? When the sun and moon are darkened is when they say, "The great day of his wrath is come." Present tense IS come, meaning that it just came. So if Matthew 24 says that the sun and moon are darkened AFTER THE TRIBULATION, and if God's wrath does not start until after the sun and moon are darkened, how can they be the same thing? So the wrath does not begin until after the sun and moon are darkened. Usually when you try to ask people to show you scripture on the pre-tribulation rapture, they cannot show you any verse. I will challenge anyone to show me one verse that actually uses the word "tribulation" to support their pre-tribulation rapture position. They cannot do it. They have to show you verses that use the word "wrath." They find verses that show that we as Christians are not under God's wrath, and they will show verses that say that we are not appointed unto wrath, and that we are saved from wrath. And they say, "See, right there, the Bible says that we will not go through the tribulation. But wait a minute: tribulation and wrath are two different things! There is no verse that any pre-trib believer can show you that uses the word "tribulation" in it to prove their doctrine. They will take you to some verse about God's wrath. Well God's wrath and the tribulation are two totally different things. Most Christians are taught in their churches and by the books that they read that these two things are the same thing. And when you try to tell them, "Hey! We are going to be here for the tribulation! The rapture does not come until AFTER THE TRIBULATION." Here is what they try to tell you: "No, God would not pour out his wrath on his own people. We are not appointed to wrath. We will be spared from his wrath." But wait a minute: is God's wrath the same as the tribulation? No. So, if we could just get people to understand what the word "tribulation" means, they would understand that the rapture comes AFTER THE TRIBULATION. It is just that people do not understand the word "tribulation" because they have this idea in their head that the tribulation is a seven year period where God is pouring out his wrath and pouring out fire and brimstone, turning water into blood, and tormenting people with scorpions and all these different plagues. That is not what the tribulation is. That is not what the Bible teaches. \r\n\r\nScene 6 - Every New Testament Mention of the Word "Tribulation" \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Those who believe in this so-called "pre-trib rapture," or a rapture that comes before the tribulation, that can happen at any moment: let's break down that term "pre-trib rapture." It has three elements to it. "Pre" means what? "Before." What does "trib" stand for? "Tribulation." Then you have "rapture." The word "rapture" is not in the Bible. The concept of the rapture is in the Bible because we see Jesus come in the clouds, people are caught up to be with him in the air, etc. So the concept of the rapture is there, but the word "rapture" is not used. Is the word "tribulation" in the Bible? If you look up every single verse that uses the word "tribulation," it is used 22 times in the New Testament. So if the New Testament uses the word "tribulation" 22 times, and everyone is going around with this doctrine called the "pre-trib rapture," shouldn't one of those 22 verses, or 22 passages or chapters, teach us something about a rapture happening before the tribulation? None of those verses says anything about there being a rapture before the tribulation or anything like that, so the pre-tribulation rapture people have to rely on a lot of interpretation, and they have to explain it to you, and it is always very complicated. I have noticed something about the Bible: God wants us to understand the Bible. He is not trying to play tricks on us and confuse us and make things difficult. He wants us to know the truth. He loves us. I have noticed that many times the first time that the Bible brings something up, he defines it for us, and he helps us understand it. That way when we see it the second time, we will know what he is talking about. The Bible reads in Matthew 13:21 \r\n\r\n(Matthew 13:21) Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: What do you see the definition of "tribulation" as? Persecution. He says "tribulation or persecution" that arises because of the word. So are these people going through tribulation because they are so bad? No, they are going through tribulation because they are standing on the word of God. And because they have taken a stand for the word of God, because they have received the word of God with all gladness, they will go through persecution or tribulation. If we are rooted and grounded in what we believe, when persecution and tribulation comes, we will endure. The first time you see the word "tribulation" used in the Bible, it is coupled with "persecution." That is the first time the word "tribulation" is used in the New Testament, and if you follow every single time throughout the New Testament that the word "tribulation" is used, 90% of the time it is talking about believers going through tribulation - saved people going through tribulation. The other two times it is used where it is not talking about saved people, it has nothing to do with end times prophecy. It is just talking about people going through tribulation in general. Christians throughout history have gone through tribulation, and our generation will not be any different. Maybe this will happen in our lifetime, maybe it will not, but if it happens in our lifetime, we will go through it as believers. We will either be killed for the cause of Christ, or hopefully we will make it through this period and make it to the rapture. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: The fifth mention of the word "tribulation" in the New Testament is found in John 16:33. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: He is speaking to believers. He is speaking to his disciples. He says, \r\n\r\n(John 16:33) These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Did he say that you will avoid the tribulation? Did he say that you will not go through tribulation? Did he say, "I would never let my people go through tribulation! I love them too much!" No! What did the first mention of "tribulation" say in Matthew 13? That if people were not rooted and grounded, and persecution or tribulation would arise because of the word, they would be offended. Look what Jesus said in this chapter that warns us of tribulation in verse 1: \r\n\r\n(John 16:1) These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: He is saying that if he does not tell you about this, if he does not warn you about the coming persecutions and tribulations and trials that you will go through in your life, when they come, you will be taken by surprise. You will be offended. You say, "Why are you preaching this sermon, Pastor Anderson?" I am preaching this sermon that ye might not be offended. You say, "Wait a minute, this sermon offends!" No, this is the sermon to stop you from being offended because Jesus said that if you know this is coming, you will not be offended. Look at verse 4: \r\n\r\n(John 16:4) But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So he says there that when these things happen you will remember that I told you so, and I am saying the same thing tonight that Jesus said. When these things begin to happen - it may not be in our lifetime; it may be 100 years from now; maybe it will be a couple years from now; we do not know when the end will be - but when it happens, you will remember that I told you. More importantly than that, because I did not make these things up, you will remember that Jesus told you. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: The next time you find the word "tribulation" is in Acts 14:22, and it says, \r\n\r\n(Acts 14:22) Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: It is interesting the statement that is made is that "we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" - a very specific statement in the Bible that when we enter into the kingdom of God, it will be through tribulation, not that we will enter into the kingdom of God before tribulation. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Did he say, "Man alive, it is great that we will be gone before the tribulation!" No, he said, "You had better confirm them. You had better firm them up on some things. You had better strengthen them because they had better know that they must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God." Any pre-tribulation rapture in mention #6? I didn't think so. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: In 2 Corinthians 7:4, the Bible says: \r\n\r\n(2 Corinthians 7:4) Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: He did not say, "I am exceeding joyful because I am not going through tribulation. I am so joyful that we will be raptured before the tribulation!" That is not what he said. He said, "I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation." Where is the pre-trib rapture in that scripture? It is not there. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: It is just amazing to me that as you look at the word "tribulation" throughout scripture, you keep finding multiple references to believers saying that they are going through tribulation. He says, "…in all our tribulation." It is not something that believers do not go through. It is something that believers have been going through their whole lives. Throughout the generations, believers have gone through tribulation. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Keep in mind, folks, God is not out to confuse us. He is not trying to mess with us. Man has been messing with you! Preachers have been messing with you! TV shows and movies have been messing with you (Left Behind, etc.). God is not messing with you. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: If we allow the Bible to be our dictionary, and we allow the Bible to define words for us, we would find that the word "tribulation" is not the wrath of God. It is persecution, it is affliction, it is trouble. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: You would think that someone could show you one verse of those 22 mentions. Show me one verse that says that we will be gone before the tribulation, or that we will be caught up before the tribulation, or that the rapture will take place before the tribulation. Yet I can show you where the Bible point blank says that immediately after the tribulation, Jesus is coming in the clouds, the trumpet will sound, and the elect will be caught up together with him in the clouds. It is that simple. Those who believe in the pre-trib rapture just have to rely on people with their elaborate interpretations and logic, and, "Well, since we don't know the day or the hour, that means it could happen at any time, and if it could happen at any time, then it must be before the tribulation." Or they will have a complicated chart to explain it to you. But if you just pick up the Bible and take it at face value - read the New Testament starting in Matthew 1 - when you get to Matthew 24, there it is, as clear as day: AFTER THE TRIULATION Jesus comes in the clouds. \r\n\r\nScene 7 - Dr. Kent Hovind Introduced \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Dr. Kent Hovind is a really famous evangelist who believed and preached the pre-trib rapture for 38 years. Well now he is in prison, and since he has been in prison, he has been reading his Bible, and he realizes that the pre-trib rapture is not found in scripture, and I want to give him a call to find out more about what made him switch. What made him realize that it is AFTER THE TRIBULATION? \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: My name is Kent Hovind. I was a high school science teacher 15 years and then became an evangelist for 20 years teaching on creation and evolution. And I've been really concerned about my view of the end times and how it fits together with scripture, and I became convinced, oh, about three years ago, that what I've been taught all my life, is not true. I've had to switch, much to the dismay of many of my fundamental brethren, to the post-trib, pre-wrath position. The Bible says the scoffers in the last days would be willingly ignorant of the creation, the flood, and the coming judgement. Well, I spent 20 years teaching all over the world about the creation and the flood, but I kind of avoided the coming judgement part because I didn't understand it myself. Over in Matthew 24, Jesus' sermon which gives us where the disciples asked him very clearly: what is the sign of your coming? And when will it happen? The same story is told again in Mark 13 and in Luke 21, so I copied pages from the Bible of all three of those passages and put them side by side - all three parallel accounts. And once you had picked out all the details, it just became more and more clear that the pre-trib rapture idea just was not true. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Why do you think so many people believe in the pre-trib rapture? Why is this doctrine so popular? \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: Because it answers an embarrassing problem. The Christians could not answer the questions about the dinosaurs. Where did they fit? So, they made up the "gap theory" and fell for it. I think the idea of a pre-trib rapture fits into that category where people have itching ears. This is what they want to hear. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Right. \r\n\r\n(Colossians 2:8) Beware lest any many spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: They want to hear, "Hey, I won't have to endure suffering." Well, Jesus said that there is coming a time of tribulation such as was not since the world began. I mean, you think the Spanish Inquisition was bad? Or that the Nazi holocaust with the Jews was bad? Or the Roman persecution of the Christians? It is going to be worse than all of those put together! \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Wow. That is amazing. \r\n\r\n(Genesis 4:8) And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: So, the world starts off with Cain killing Abel - the bad guys killing the good guys. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Right. \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: It has been that way all through history. And Jesus told us that when they kill you or when they persecute you, rejoice, because your rewards are great in the kingdom of heaven. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: If we really take a biblical definition of what "tribulation" means (not what it has been corrupted into meaning) - if we actually take a biblical definition of "tribulation," wouldn't you say that you are going through tribulation right now? \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: Oh, yes. "Tribulation" is what the world does to us, and it has already happened for thousands of years. Jesus said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world." Christians should expect tribulation, and we get great rewards if we go through it patiently. \r\n\r\nScene 8 - Timeline of the Book of Revelation \r\n\r\nDr. Pastor Anderson: Now, since this class is about "Religious Extremism," this might fall into that category in some people's minds, to think that there will literally be an end to this world - that there will be a literal, bodily second coming Jesus Christ. That is why I wanted to just explain to you in a nutshell - I want to just give you a brief timeline of what is going to take place according to the Bible, and how this will all happen. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: I think the key to understanding the book of Revelation is understanding how it breaks down. God gave us the book of Revelation to be just that - a revelation - to reveal these things to us, not to hide them. It is not the book of Camouflage. It is the book of Revelation, and God wants it to be easily understood. That is why he gave it to us in a format that is easy to understand. When you start reading in chapter one, you are at the time of Christ or thereabouts because John is on the isle of Patmos, and John has been persecuted for preaching the Gospel, so we are talking about less than a century after Christ's coming to this earth. Then he receives a vision where he sees the Lord Jesus Christ who appears unto him. Then in chapters 2-3 Jesus Christ gives a message unto these seven churches of Asia, and obviously those are churches that were in the first century A.D., at that time. Then in chapters 4-5 we see the vision up in Heaven where it describes events going on in Heaven. Then in chapter 6 we get into the events of the tribulation. Chapter 7 is where the great multitude appears in Heaven - obviously the rapture - all nations and all kindreds are represented there. Then in chapters 8-9 you have God pouring out his wrath upon this earth. Then chapter 10 is a parenthetical chapter talking about a few things before the seventh trumpet sounds. Then in chapter 11 we have the 7th trumpet sounding. All that to say this: if you look at the book of Revelation, the first 11 chapters follow a chronology that makes perfect sense. You start out around the time Christ, as far as the same century as Christ. Then you get into the events of the future: the tribulation, then the rapture, then God pouring out his wrath. Then when that seventh trumpet sounds in chapter 11, there is a finality, where he says, "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. But what is interesting is that when you get to the end of chapter 11, you have that finality at the end. Well, then you get into chapter 12, and there is a major gear change in the book of Revelation because look at verse 1 of chapter 12 that we just looked at. It says: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:1) And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:2) And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:3) And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.\r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:4) And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Now pay close attention to verse 5: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:5) And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Now obviously that child is Jesus Christ because in the Old Testament and the New Testament, the Bible talks about Jesus Christ ruling this earth with a rod of iron, and it is referring to his millennial reign that is coming in the future. So really the best way that I can help you to understand the book of Revelation is to tell you to cut it in half right at chapter 11. 1-11 if one half, and 12-22 is the other half. Then if you put those halves side by side, you will see the same events from two different angles: \r\n\r\n1 1st Century A.D. 12 \r\n\r\n2 \r\n\r\n3 \r\n\r\n4 \r\n\r\n5 \r\n\r\n6 Tribulation 13 \r\n\r\n7 Rapture 14 \r\n\r\n15 \r\n\r\n8 Wrath of God 16 \r\n\r\n9 \r\n\r\n10 \r\n\r\n11 \r\n\r\nBabylon 17 \r\n\r\n18 \r\n\r\nArmageddon 19 \r\n\r\nWhite Throne 20 \r\n\r\nNew Heaven/Earth 21 \r\n\r\n22 \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Why would God do that? Why would God tell the same story twice in the book of Revelation? Well, why did he tell us the Gospel story four times in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? Why did he give us the books of 1 & 2 Samuel and 1 & 2 Kings, but then he also gave us 1 & 2 Chronicles to give us another angle, another perspective, and we can learn a lot from comparing the books of the Kings with the books of the Chronicles, or comparing Matthew to Mark, and Mark to Luke, and Luke to John, and these give us different perspectives. Well that is the same way that we understand the book of Revelation. That will help you understand the book of Revelation when you understand that chronology. Now some people think that Revelation is not in chronological order at all, but the term "after this" or the term "after these things" occurs 10 times in the book of Revelation. If we see over and over again "after this" and "after these things," God is giving us an order of events. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: It is a ridiculous way to try to interpret the Bible or read the Bible to negate the fact that the Bible says "after this," and people say, "It is not in chronological order. It does not make sense." All throughout the Bible, that is how you read scripture. A funny example: in John 3:21, it says: \r\n\r\n(John 3:21) But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: Then verse 22 says, "After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea;" and it would be ridiculous for me to stand here and say, "No, verse 22 actually took place before verse 21," when verse 22 says "after these things." We would look at that and say, Of course, that is how it is written, and that is what it means. Then we get to the book of Revelation, and like I said, 10 times you read "after these things" or "after this," yet people say, "No, it is not in chronological order. It does not make sense." It is just a dumb way of reading the Bible. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So, if you get the idea that it is chronological, but it starts over again in chapter 12, that will help you to understand. I want to go through just a couple of chapters here to show you the order of events of the end times. This could happen 100 years from now. We might all be gone, but I think it is very likely that it will happen in the near future. In fact, I would be shocked if these things did not happen at least in my lifetime if I live out my normal lifespan. I am 31 years old, and at the speed which things are going right now, I would be surprised if this does not happen in the next 40 years. When I start to get into the message tonight, I think you will understand a little bit why I say that. Here is what starts out first the tribulation. The Bible says that the Devil, or Satan, will be cast out of Heaven. Now you say, "Wait a minute, Pastor Anderson, hasn't that already happened?" But the answer is no. People think that the Devil is in Hell right now, but in reality, the Devil has never even been to Hell because the Bible makes it very clear that the Devil is on this earth walking about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. The Devil and all his demons are present upon this earth in the Bible. He goes back and forth between Earth and Heaven, and he talks to God. If you read the book of Job, the Devil comes and stands before God and has a conversation with God in Heaven about his servant Job. So the Devil right now goes back and forth. Well, the Bible talks about how some day the Devil will be cast down from Heaven: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:7) And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:8) And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:9) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:10) And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:11) And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 12:12) Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So, what do we see here? There is war in Heaven, and the Bible teaches that the Devil loses this battle. He loses this war in Heaven, and because he loses the battle, he and his angels, which here it shows that it is one third of the angels, they are cast down unto the earth. Basically this is Satan being cast out of Heaven, and he knows he only has a little bit of time, and he will go out to persecute the believers and persecute the saints and try to destroy them. Look at chapter 13. Here is where that war begins. In Revelation 12:17, he is going out to make war. How will he do it? How is the Devil going to make war with the believers? \r\n\r\nScene 9: The Antichrist \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: The next thing that we will see happen prophetically is what is called the tribulation. The tribulation is a period where there will be a lot of things happening on this earth that are catastrophic. There will be famines. There will be pestilences. There will be warfare - an extreme amount of warfare. A lot of people will be starving to death and dying of disease. A lot of horrible things will be happening. Well, out of all this warfare and cataclysm that will be taking place during the tribulation, (not supernatural cataclysm, not God raining fire and brimstone, but rather natural disasters, warfare, famine, caused by human beings) there is going to be a man that will emerge and become a dictator of the entire world who is known as "the antichrist." This is not a fairy tale. This will really happen, and in fact, we can already see the signs that it is beginning to happen. The Bible tells us that some day there will be a one world government. Right now we have many different governments. We have the United States, we have Russia, we have China - they are all separate, sovereign nations (you have probably heard the term "sovereign") - all these separate nations. Well, one day, the Bible says that all of those nations will unite together and form a one world government. Then once they have formed that one world government, they will hand all the power to one person that will be the head of that government, and that person is known as the "antichrist." Who has every heard of the antichrist before? Everyone has heard that term before. The "antichrist" is a biblical term. You will often hear the Bible talk about "the beast," or "the beast from the sea," or "the beast with seven heads and ten horns," or the "man of sin," or the "son of perdition," but the Bible also uses the term "antichrist." I like to use term "antichrist:" it is a term that people understand, and it is a biblical term. I would like to show you where the Bible mentions the term "antichrist" because the Bible tells us that there is person coming some day who is called the antichrist. Before Jesus Christ comes back there will be a decoy, a fake Christ. Do you see what I mean? The antichrist is a guy who is claiming to be the second coming of Christ, but he is an impostor. But since Christians now are being taught to expect Jesus to come back at any moment, it is perfect because guess who is really showing up - the antichrist. Why does the Bible call it "antichrist"? Because there is a man coming called the "antichrist" (singular) who will say that he is Jesus Christ. When that antichrist shows up in the tribulation and says, "I am Jesus Christ," they will accept him as their messiah. A lot of people will teach, "Oh, when Jesus Christ comes in the clouds, the Jews will finally realize that he was their messiah, and they will accept him." No, they will accept the antichrist! That is what the Bible says. Jesus said: \r\n\r\n(John 5:43) I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: I think Satan's plan with the pre-tribulation rapture is to get everyone to have this mentality that "Jesus Christ is coming at any moment." "We are expecting Jesus Christ at any moment! He could come today! He is coming today!" but really the person who is coming is the antichrist. And the antichrist, when he comes, will be the head of a one world government and a one world religion where he claims to be the messiah. It says in verse 18 of 1 John 2: \r\n\r\n(1 John 2:18) Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Is that first mention singular or plural? So they have heard that antichrist (singular) shall come. So, there is one antichrist coming, is there not? But are there not many antichrists even right now? That is what the verse says. Who are these antichrists? \r\n\r\n(1 John 2:22) Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: In order to believe that Jesus is not the Christ, you have to believe that there is a Christ, and that it is not Jesus. The word "Christ" means "Messiah." The Bible says in John 1:41, "We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ." So the Bible defines the word "Christ" as "Messiah." The two are interchangeable. So let me ask you this: can you think of a religion out there that says that there is a messiah coming, but that it is not Jesus - Jesus was not him. The Jewish religion teaches that there is a messiah, all right, but that it was not Jesus. They are stilling waiting for the messiah. They say that Jesus was not the messiah, and they are still waiting for the messiah. The Bible says that they will receive the antichrist as their messiah. Evangelical Christianity that believes that Jesus can come back at any moment, those that are not saved, those that do not believe the truth, many of them will be deceived and think, "This is the second coming of Jesus Christ!" The muslims today are waiting for a great prophet and a great messiah to come that is actually greater than Mohammad. President Ahmadinejad, the President of Iran - who has ever heard of him before? President Ahmadinejad spoke to the United Nations General Assembly a year or two ago, and when he did, he gave a brief synopsis of Islam. \r\n\r\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad: The essence of the message of prophets is one and the same. Every messenger has endorsed the messenger before him and given glad tidings about the next prophet to come who presented a more complete version of the religion in accordance with man's capacity at that time. This trend continued until the last messenger of God who presented the perfection of an all-inclusive religion. Nimrod countered hazrat Abraham. Pharaoh countered hazrat Moses, and the greedy countered hazrat Jesus Christ and hazrat Mohammad - may peace be upon all our prophets. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: And he said that Islam believes that Abraham was a great prophet, Moses was a great prophet, and then there was Jesus, and then there was Mohammad - and the Muslim is nodding her head so I must be getting this right! And basically what Ahmadinejad said was that each of those men brought more truth than the one who came before as man was ready for it. They brought more illumination and more detail and more truth. He said that in the future another prophet will come that will even be greater than Mohammad and will bring the next level of illumination. So Islam is looking for a messianic figure to come. They are waiting for the Imam Mahdi. \r\n\r\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad: Oh God, hasten the arrival of Imam al Mahdi and grant him good health and victory, and make us his followers, and those who attest to his rightfulness. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: The Buddhists are looking for the Fifth Buddha to come. Those that are in Tibet that follow the Dalai Lama: they believe that the Dalai Lama keeps being reincarnated into another person - that spirit of the Dalai Lama. They will believe that the antichrist is the new embodiment of the Dalai Lama. The Muslims will look at him as the Imam Mahdi. The Christians will look at him as the second coming of Christ. The Jews will look at him as the messiah. All of these major religions will rally around him, and people will say, "Isn't this great how we are all uniting finally! We're putting aside our differences, and this man is so wonderful!" and they will worship this man. This impostor, this antichrist, is going to come. The world government will put him into power and give him all the power, and they will also declare him to be God. They will declare him to be the second coming of Christ. He will basically be killed. The Bible says he will receive a deadly wound to his head, his deadly wound will be healed, and he will come back to life. Then he is going to be proclaimed as the second coming of Jesus Christ. He is going to be proclaimed as God in the flesh, and all the nations of the world, all the peoples of the world will worship this guy. Basically every religion will accept him as their messiah, but the Bible says that those who are saved will not be deceived by him. The rest of the world will worship him and believe him because he is going to perform miracles, the Bible says, and he is going to do all these signs and wonders, and he is going to bring in this world government. Sometimes you will try to warn people about a one world government. You try to warn them about some of the trends that we see happening of going to a cashless society. There are so many Christians who - you talk to Christians about a one world government, or you talk to them about a cashless society and all these different checkpoints that are being set up and the police state, and they call you a "conspiracy theorist." I am sure you have been called a conspiracy theorist throughout the years. \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: Yes, many times. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: But can someone really be a Bible-believing Christian and deny that there will be a one world government some day? \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: I don't think you could read the Bible without seeing the fact that it has always been Satan's plan to rule the world like Pinky and the Brain, and he wants a one world government. He wants to be God. \r\n\r\nScene 10 - the Mark of the Beast \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: When this man is ruling the entire world, he will command that everyone receive what is called the "mark of the beast." Who has ever heard of the mark of the beast? The Bible says that the mark of the beast will be something in your right hand or in your forehead, and that no one will be able to buy or sell without having this mark. Now people may have read this a few hundred years ago and said, "How can you do that? How can you make people not be able to buy or sell unless they have this mark? Can't you just pull out cash?" Think about the way the technology is. This money that I hold in my hand, this federal reserve note, is a piece of paper. It is worthless. It does not have any intrinsic value. When you see a cashless society starting to develop - more and more we are getting away from using cash… \r\n\r\nMan on TV: There will be a time when physical money is just going to cease to exist. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: So is paper money a relic of a bygone era? \r\n\r\nMan of TV: 95% of the transactions in America or more now have nothing to do with physical pieces of paper or coins. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: Have you ever wondered if one day cold hard cash will simply cease to exist? It is a reality that some say we should accept. Greenbacks and coins have become an inconvenience. \r\n\r\nAfrican official: The principle is that we have to move this economy from a cash-based economy to a cashless economy. This involves the banks. It involves telecom companies. It involves providers of ATMs and POSs. It involves a cultural change. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: Just what do you call money these days? Is it a handful of coins and notes? Or are cards taking over? And our some form of money coming to the end of their lives, like the check? \r\n\r\nDr. Kent Hovind: Suppose every store in your town said, "Hey, we're not taking cash anymore," and suppose they said, "We are not even going to take checks or credit cards because there is too much fraud - too many stolen credit cards and too many bounced checks. It has to be an electronic transaction." \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Let's face it: the paper money is not really worth anything anyway. It is a piece of paper. It may as well be Monopoly money. It is not gold. It is not silver. It has no intrinsic value. So first, they have gotten us used to using pieces of paper that are worthless. Today I can exchange that piece of paper for goods and services, but if someone said tomorrow, "That money is not worth anything," then it would not be worth anything. Do you remember the Confederate States of America? Do you remember the confederate money? People saved up confederate money in the mattress. Guess what, it wasn't worth anything. Well they could do that to you, too, and just say, "Well, your paper money is no good. Now it's all just in your account. It's all tied in with your Facebook and Youtube channel and your gmail, and it's great because there is no identity theft. You don't have to worry about leaving your wallet at home. You don't have to worry about your credit card being stolen. It is all just completely cashless." We could control the drugs because there won't be any way to have a cash transaction. It's to prevent crime. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: It's sci-fi technology that's about to enter the checkout lane all in the name of speed and convenience. You'll be able to buy anything from bread to beer if you agree to give the store your ultimate identity. \r\n\r\nACLU guy: It scares the heck out of me. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: Once you have your groceries scanned, now what do you do? You touch your index finger to the image reader, and you have paid in about 3 seconds all with the touch of your fingertip. It's called biometrics: an automated way to recognize you based on your unique biological characteristics. \r\n\r\nACLU guy: Do not be sold on this because of a convenience. \r\n\r\nFormer QT employee: You know, today it's a fingerprint, tomorrow a microchip. Maybe that ushers in the mark of the beast. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: This man quit his management job at Quik Trip when the convenience store chain told him that he had to swipe his finger to clock in and clock out. \r\n\r\nFormer QT employee: And although it may be optional today, who knows about tomorrow. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: Experts say that biometrics are about to pervade every aspect of our economy and daily lives. \r\n\r\nWoman on TV: You put your finger in their, and my name comes up, and she's got all my information. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: And it's that quick? \r\n\r\nWoman on TV: It's very quick. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: Love it? \r\n\r\nWoman on TV: Love it. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: People across the world already use biometrics. The US government, the airlines, gas stations - even Walt Disney World uses technology that can read guests' blood veins in lieu of carrying day passes. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: This one world government will have so much power that it will be able to dictate that no person on this earth will be able to buy or sell without having the mark of the beast. Now it's interesting that the King James Bible very clearly says that the mark of the beast - this mark that will be required for you to buy or sell - will be located IN their right hand or IN their forehead. This could be some kind of an implantable chip, where in order to buy or sell, you will just need to scan this chip. What is going to happen one day is that they will say, "This paper money - that one hundred dollars in your pocket - it's worthless. You must scan to pay. It is all electronic now. You go to the grocery store, you ring up your groceries, and then just *beep*. If you don't have a hand, no problem, we can put it in your head because everyone has a head! You will just *beep* check out at the checkout. All of the money will just be in electronic format, and it is already going that way. Cellphones are starting to have a scanner. So, let's say there is an exchange of goods and services between two people. Okay, that will be $10.50. Go ahead and just give me your right hand so I can scan it with my smartphone. *beep* Okay, now I just took the money from his account. Oh, you just gave my son a piano lesson. Let me get you paid. *beep* Think about it now: the smartphone can be used to scan the mark of the beast, and you can't buy or sell without it. \r\n\r\nNews Lady: In medical news tonight, a chip the size of a grain of rice could save your life. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: The year is 2017. You are rushed to a hospital unconscious with no ID or medical history, but thanks to a microchip under your skin, it is all there. Science fiction twenty years ago, but a biometric reality today. \r\n\r\nProfessor: I think it is possible to free us completely of our wallets and keys using biometric technology if that is what people want in ten years time. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: The challenge is to safeguard our privacy in a brave new world. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: New microchip technology now makes it possible for the emergency room staff to find out about your medical history at the touch of a computer key. \r\n\r\nHarvard Doctor: So many emergency physicians have to operate blind. We have to make medical decisions not knowing what medicines you take or what allergies you have. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: Harvard doctor says that this Radio Frequency Identification chip may solve that problem. He had implanted in his right upper arm. A scanner reads an identification number. Those 16 digits are then entered into a secure website where his medical history is stored. EMT worker says that the chip could help emergency workers. \r\n\r\nEMT Worker: One of the big things is if you ever have any type of trauma patient where they come in, and they are unable to give you their information and/or their medical history. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: Harvard doctor says that the benefits are clear. \r\n\r\nHarvard Doctor: I'm a rock climber, and I believe that if I fall off a cliff, and you find me unconscious, the comfort of being able to scan me and figure out who I am outweighs my concern for privacy. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: The chip is encased in unbreakable glass and is about the size of a grain of rice. The procedure is done with anesthesia and is relatively pain free. \r\n\r\nHarvard Doctor: It's like putting a knitting needle under your skin. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: But in this case, he says that getting something under your skin is a good thing. \r\n\r\nMale News Anchor: It starts like this: here's this cat, and five years later, we found out she's back. Then somebody said, “You know if it’s good enough for a cat, I’ve got mom and dad at home and dad kind of wanders off sometimes and maybe we could put a microchip with his medical records in case something ever happens. Sounds good.” And then somebody says, “Well, if it’s good enough for my cat, good enough for grandma and grandpa, what about my baby?” No more Amber alerts. Never having to worry about that fear of an abducted child. And then, we say, “Well, you know what? Maybe WE should have them. And on that chip, we’re going to have everything. Credit cards, drivers license. Think about it. Metro cards. No more wallets. Think about this, you don’t carry keys anymore. So the question I want everybody at home to ask is: Is that a good idea? Because that’s where we’re going next. \r\n\r\nFemale News Anchor: It’s too sci-fi for me, I’m telling you that. \r\n\r\nMale News Anchor: It’s here! It’s here. \r\n\r\nFemale News Anchor: I know it’s here and with pets and in a limited basis but for humans… \r\n\r\nMale News Anchor: But you’re child… \r\n\r\nFemale News Anchor: You’re child…I mean, come on... \r\n\r\nSteven Anderson: People in the past might have wondered, “How could this be implemented? How do you stop people from buying or selling if they don’t have a mark?” But we see now the technology developing that would make it very easy for no one to be able to buy or sell without having this mark. And guess what? Most people only have seven days of food in their house or ten days of food in their house, so if you can’t buy or sell you’re going to be in a world of hurt. And basically the Bible says there’s also going to be a law that says if you won’t worship the antichrist you’ll be killed. This guy’s great, he’s doing a lot of great things, he’s bringing people together. Only one catch: Get on board or be put to death. And when you hear about that, when you look at that, you probably say, “Well, in that case, I guess we’re all going to die that are believers, those that believe on Christ. I guess we’re all going to be beheaded. And the Bible talks about us being beheaded. We’re all going to be beheaded. But here’s the thing. If this were allowed to continue, you’re right, all believers would be killed. Because think about it, look at the technology, look at the surveillance cameras that are going up everywhere, the satellites. Now the police are using drones with cameras to fly around and spy on you. Have you seen that? Surveillance drones. Now they’re installing microphones at street corners where they can listen in to what you’re saying. And it’s like the dystopic novel “1984.” That’s the way our country is going, to where it’s a total surveillance society. It used to be that you just got on an airplane. Now you have to be molested by the TSA. Now you’ve got to go through a naked body scanner. Now you’ve got to be scanned. You’ve got to be padded down. You’ve got to have ID with you at all times and police are constantly, “Where’s your ID? Where are your papers? Your papers are not in order!” And that’s the country that we’re living in now. And so this is going to continue to the point where it’s going to be really hard to escape this prison planet. But let me say this: We will not all be killed. Many will be killed, don’t get me wrong. Many Christians will be beheaded and killed for the cause of Christ. But I’ll say this: We will not all be killed because this will be cut short. And the Bible says: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:22) And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: And the Bible says that in the midst of this, Jesus Christ will return. Remember we talked earlier about the second coming of Christ. He will return. Just when they think they’ve defeated Christianity, they’ve got their global government, they’ve got their one world government with Satan at its head, Jesus Christ comes in the clouds and that’s when the rapture takes place and that’s when he begins to pour out his wrath on this earth. And you can read about it in Revelation. He’s going to be turning water into blood. He’s going to be scorching the trees and grass. He’s going to be sending these locusts from hell that are going to be stinging people with tails like scorpions. If you haven’t read the book of Revelation, I strongly recommend it. And don’t read the NIV. Read the King James Version, ok? If you’re going to take the time to read it, why don’t you read the real thing? Accept no imitation. Look at Chapter 13 Verse 1: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:1) And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:2) And the beast [Antichrist] which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon [Satan] gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So this beast that is described, the Bible says the dragon is the one who gave him his power and gave him his seat and gave him his authority. Look at verse 3: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:3) And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Now does forty and two months ring a bell with time and times and half a time and twelve hundred and sixty days? See how these things all tie in? He says in verse 6: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:6) And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Watch this. Verse seven. Here’s the key: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:7) And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Now didn’t we see in chapter 12 verse 17 that the dragon’s goal was to make war with those who believe in Christ and keep the commandments of God? Here he says it was given unto him to make war with the saints – Watch this – to overcome them. Who is going to win in this war between the saints and the devil on this earth? The devil. He said he’s going to make war with the saints and overcome them. According to Revelation 13, the antichrist goal is to make war with the saints. So he doesn’t want Christians to take the mark of the beast to avoid persecution. He wants every Christian dead. You say, “Well that’s depressing.” Well, just read to the end of the book and you’ll see who wins in the end. This is just a temporary setback in chapter 13. But he says in verse 7: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:7-8) And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So this man that’s called the beast, this man who has power over all nations, all kindreds, all tongues, his goal is to make war with the saints and the Bible says that everyone on the earth shall worship him. Wait a minute. No, it doesn’t. It says everyone on the earth will worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. So let me ask you this. Are those whose names ARE in the book of life, are they worshipping him? No. Well, the Bible says he will be so believable and so smooth that he would deceive the elect if it were possible. But God will not allow any of those who are saved to be deceived by this guy. So everybody who is truly saved, even those who have been sucked in by a pre-trib rapture, when they start seeing it happen, or hopefully when they see this documentary, they’ll realize, “Wait a minute. This is happening. This is the antichrist. I can’t take this. I shouldn’t worship this guy. This isn’t really Christ. So anybody who won’t worship him is going to be killed. And anyone who won’t worship him can’t buy or sell. You’re not just going to go to Walgreen’s and get the mark of the beast. It’s not going to be something where you just show up at the post office. “Ok, can I get my chip so I can buy or sell?” No, the Bible is clear. You must worship the antichrist in order to receive this chip. Now even many decades ago, you had lie detectors. Now they’re developing brain scan type technologies. I believe that probably in order to get the mark of the beast, you’re going to have to worship the antichrist and pledge allegiance under the antichrist and he’ll know if you’re telling the truth. \r\n\r\nNews Anchor: Sci-fi is here. Tomorrow is here now. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Not only that, but if you think about it, the transportation now is so controlled. There are checkpoints on the highways for trying to drive and then if you try to go on an airplane, the TSA is going to put you through a naked body scanner and so it seems like the control grid is being put in place so that you’re not going to be able to function in society unless you bow down to this beast and worship the beast and receive the mark. \r\n\r\nKent Hovind: Exactly right. And we’re going to be villainized. Jesus said very clearly his disciples would be hated for his name’s sake. Anybody who doesn’t cooperate with this wonderful new world order that they’re planning is going to be looked at as the enemy. For instance, with school, when you go to take your kindergartener to put him in school and they say you cannot come to school unless you’re vaccinated. Well, what if you have an aversion to vaccines and say, “Hey, I think this may be causing autism. It may be causing a host of things. I don’t know, but I don’t want to take a chance. And I don’t see any scriptural equivalent to vaccination where you put some poison into your body to be inoculated against more.” \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Right, right. \r\n\r\nKent Hovind: The fact is, the school says you can’t come unless you’re vaccinated so now you have a choice. Do you stand by your convictions or do you bow down and give your kid the vaccine for convenience? It will be the same with the mark of the beast. It was the same eighty years ago with social security numbers. People had an aversion to having a number. “Oh, I’m a name.” And then they slowly have gotten to now where everybody has one and doesn’t even think about it. Is that step one, two, or three toward the final goal of making a one world kingdom? \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Satan is cast out of heaven. He knows he has a short time. He goes to make war against the believers and the saints. And what does he do? He does it by putting a man in power, doesn’t he? The dragon gave him his power. He puts a man in power over the entire world, over every kindred and every tongue. And this man will carry out the devil’s war against the saints. The Bible says in verse 11: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:11-12) And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So here this man is demanding worship. It says in verse 13: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:13-14) And he doeth great wonders [miracles], so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:15) And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: And you say, “What in the world is that image of the beast that is given life? As we get closer and closer to this, I think that we can kind of understand the technology a little more, so I don’t really know exactly what kind of an image this is going to be. But it’s some kind of an image of the beast that can speak and cause that as many as will not worship are killed. Now this kind of reminds me of Daniel, chapter 3. Remember Nebuchadnezzar who was king over the civilized world at that time? Do you remember how he made a great image and they had to worship that image? And what would happen if they didn’t worship the image? They were killed, right? Isn’t that similar to what we see here? That’s a picture of the antichrist. Look at verse 16. Here’s the key: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 13:16-18) And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six [666]. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: This is one of the tools that Satan is using to persecute the believers. The mark of the beast is a tool that he is using to make war with the saints, because of the fact that if you can’t buy or sell, it’s pretty hard to function in today’s world, isn’t it? Or in any world. So not only does he make a law that says if you don’t worship the antichrist you’re going to be killed. That’s a persecution right there. That’s making war with the saints. He also makes it impossible for the saints to buy or sell because they don’t have the mark of the beast, and the mark of the beast is only going to be given to those who worship the beast. And those that are saved, those that are saints, they’re not going to worship the beast. The Bible is clear on that in Matthew 24 and elsewhere. So they’re not going to be able to buy or sell and they’re going to have a death warrant on them. Now imagine yourself right now in a world – and I didn’t say in a nation, I didn’t say in a country, I said in a WORLD – where you can’t buy or sell and where there’s a warrant out for you to be put to death. Can you imagine how difficult it would be to survive in a world like that? Not only that, what about all the surveillance cameras that are going in? What about the license plate reading cameras? What about the naked body scanners? What about the showing your ID at checkpoints? Showing your ID to get on a train? Showing your ID to get on an airplane? And you know what? Pretty soon you’re going to have to show something else. “OK, let’s see your right hand. OK, you’re good to go. Have a nice day.” This is not farfetched at all. Maybe when people read this a few hundred years ago they didn’t look at it the same way as we look at it. When we look at it, it has a little bit of flesh on it, doesn’t it? That’s why I think that this may be close. Christians today are not ready for this at all. They’re not ready for it at all. You know what you need to do? You need to prepare yourself spiritually and be ready so that you’re not, “What’s happening?” You need to be ready. You need to be prepared. That’s why God warns us and warns us and warns us and warns us. That’s why Paul even warned the people of his day. Obviously they weren’t living in the days of the great tribulation, but they went through their own tribulations like every believer does. He said, “We warned you. Verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass, as ye know.” And so we need to be warned and to understand that this is coming so that we can handle it. \r\n\r\nScene 11 - Imminence \r\n\r\nRonald Rasmussen: Christians today are not being warned about the events they will face in the great tribulation. Instead, pastors across America are teaching their people that the rapture will take place before the antichrist carries out his war with the saints and that the rapture will be the very first event on God’s prophetic timeline. This doctrine, known as imminence, teaches that Christ may return in the clouds at any moment and that there will be no signs of his coming. However, the Bible teaches that Christ’s coming is not imminent and that there are other events that must take place first. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: You’ve probably heard this doctrine that says that Jesus could come today. Who’s heard that before? It’s called the imminent return of Christ. They believe that Jesus is coming back at any moment. I’ve asked people many times when they tell me Jesus can come at any moment, “Where does it say that in the Bible?” And what they inevitably come back at me with is, “The Bible says no man knoweth the day or the hour of his coming.” And a lot of times they just can’t show you and have to help them find it. And he said, “Well, I don’t have it in front of me. I don’t know the exact chapter. But I know that Jesus said that no man knoweth the day or the hour.” I said, “Let me help you. He said it in Matthew 24:36.” Let me read for you what the Bible says, because I want to show you how unbiblical this is because this is mainstream Christianity. If you went down to the Christian bookstore right now, they would have all kinds of books and videos and who’s ever heard of this film “Left Behind?” Complete fairytale. Nothing to do with the Bible. Completely unbiblical. And the Bible says in Matthew 24:36: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:36) But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So people will take that verse and say, “See right there? No man knoweth the day or the hour. That means it could happen at any moment.” But notice he said, “But of that day no man knoweth the day or the hour.” So the question is, “Which day?” It’s the day that he just finished talking about. Here’s the thing. Back in verse 29, he said that day is after the tribulation. He said in verse 29: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:29) Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of heavens shall be shaken: \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: He describes the events that are going to happen. Then he says: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 24:36) But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So we don’t know the day or the hour but one thing we do know is that it is after the tribulation. People who believe in the pre-tribulation rapture will do these mental gymnastics where you will try to show them, “See, it says right there AFTER THE TRIBULATION.” This is what they will say, “That’s not about the rapture. That’s not the rapture.” You say, “Well, how do you know?” “Well, because it’s after the tribulation. And of course we know that the rapture is before the tribulation.” But then you’ll ask them, “Well, where does the Bible say that the rapture could happen any moment?” “Well, right there, it says no man knoweth the day or the hour.” “You just said this wasn’t about the rapture.” So, when it says it’s after the tribulation, Matthew 24 is not about the rapture. But when it says that no man knoweth the day or the hour, now all of a sudden Matthew 24 is about the rapture again. And when it says two are in the field, one taken and the other left, well, that’s about the rapture again. “Just shut up and do what you’re told. Just shut up and believe in the pre-trib rapture because I said so.” You say, “Give both sides. Be fair. Give both sides.” “OK, here’s the other side. Shut up and believe what I told you to say and quit asking questions. Shut up and believe it because I said so.” That’s the pre-trib side. It’s true. They’ve got nothing. I’ve got scripture after scripture after scripture, and they’ve got a whole lot of nothing. At least other false doctrines are based on some kind of a Bible verse that they’re twisting and people will take a Bible verse and take it out of context and twist it. The pre-tribulation rapture is not even twisting any scripture. They don’t even have a scripture. There is no scripture that says anything about the rapture taking place before the tribulation. It’s just a doctrine that’s not based on scripture whatsoever. It’s based on tradition. It’s based on a book or a chart that somebody read. It’s not based on the Bible. It didn’t come from the Bible. It doesn’t have its origins in the Bible. I find that whenever I explain this to people who are in the pew, they have no problem understanding this doctrine. It’s the people in the pulpit who will not face this doctrine, and I’ll tell you why. The pre-trib rapture is the popular doctrine. If you want to be popular, you’re going to preach the pre-trib rapture. You start preaching that the rapture comes after the tribulation, and you’re going to be ostracized, you’re going to be blackballed, you’re going to be rejected from fellowship, because they do not want to change on this doctrine. Because there are people out there who have an agenda of making sure that nobody hears the truth on this doctrine. It’s true. And the way that they keep this doctrine in the dark is through fear and intimidation. I talk to pastors all the time. I show them the truth on this. They agree with me. But they will not go into their pulpit and preach on this doctrine, because they are afraid of all their pastor friends turning on them. They’re not going to have the speaking engagements. They’re not going to be able to preach in these churches because you’ve got to be pre-trib to be in the club. And if you’re not pre-trib, you’re not in the club. Many times they won’t accept it because they don’t want to eat crow because they’ve been preaching it wrong all these years. They don’t want to admit that. They don’t want to admit that their Bible college taught them wrong. They don’t want to admit that they made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes. We all grow. We all learn new things. If you’re wrong on something, you’ve got to be corrected on it. The Bible says in Galations 1:10: \r\n\r\n(Galations 1:10) For do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: These preachers need to decide whether pleasing men is more important, by preaching what’s popular, preaching the pre-trib rapture because that’s what everybody wants to hear, because they like the movie and they have the video game and the board game and the DVD, or go with what the Bible actually says and get up and preach that the rapture comes after the tribulation. It’s a perfect example of people taking what man says over what God says. It’s a classic example of not making the Bible your final authority and just going with tradition, going with what you’ve been taught, going with what people are saying, going with the flow, instead of going with what the Bible says. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: I used to believe in the pre-tribulation rapture. It’s what I was taught since I was a child and you never really question what you’re told, but when I was exposed to the truth and I began to see the scriptures and what the Bible actually taught, I had to personally make a choice whether I was just going to go along to get along, whether I was just going to go with the flow, or if I was going to take a stand for what I believe and take a stand for what I knew was true. In my personal life I’ve been attacked and I’ve had people talk bad about me because of my stand on the pre-tribulation rapture, but I would hope that maybe if you’re listening to this or you’re watching this or you start to see the truth in regards to this, that you would just step out by faith and you would take the stand and maybe help us be able to turn the tide against this unscriptural doctrine that is the pre-tribulation rapture. \r\n\r\nKent Hovind: Another key verse that got me was 2 Thessalonians, Chapter 2, Verses 1 through 3: \r\n\r\n(2 Thessalonians 2:1-3) Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ [so he’s referring to the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming] , and by our gathering together unto him [a reference to the rapture], that ye be not shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ [again referring to the rapture] is at hand. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: He says, “Look, it’s not AT hand. It’s not the next event that’s going to happen.” He says, “Let no man deceive you by any means for that day (talking about the day that we’ll be gathered together) shall not come except there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.” So there it’s proven in scripture that the day of our gathering together with the Lord Jesus Christ shall not come until there’s a falling away and the man of sin be revealed. The only thing that’s imminent is the fact that the antichrist is coming. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So the Bible flat out tells us that the day of Christ is not at hand. He said if anybody tries to tell you that the day of Christ is at hand, that person is lying to you. That person is a deceiver. He said don’t be deceived by a word or by a spirit or even by a letter as from us, a letter claiming to be from us saying that the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive by any means. That day shall not come except X, Y, and Z happen first. The rapture simply cannot happen at any moment. The tribulation has to happen first. The antichrist has to come into power first. The sun and moon are going to be darkened before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. The Bible is real clear. That day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed. The antichrist will be revealed. The antichrist will sit in the temple of God and declare himself to be God. The antichrist will be in power before the rapture happens. It’s that simple. But if you look at Luke 17, it actually chronologically comes before Matthew 24, because Matthew 24 is a parallel passage with Luke 21. So in Luke 17 we read about the first recorded incident of Jesus teaching his disciples about this doctrine. The Bible says: \r\n\r\n(Luke 17:26) As it was in the days of Noe [Noah], so shall it be also in the days of the son of man [Jesus Christ]. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: A lot of people will take this and say that this means that people are going to be just as wicked as they were in the days of Noah. Also, he says as it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be also in the days of the coming of the son of man. And people will say, “Yes, it will be just as wicked as it was in Sodom and Gomorrah.” And they will point at all the things that are going on in our society that would mirror what was going on in Sodom and Gomorrah. And they will say it was just as wicked as it was in Sodom and Gomorrah or it’s going to be just as wicked as it was in Noah’s day. But really, that’s not the comparison that Jesus is making. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: In verse 28 he says: \r\n\r\n(Luke 17:28-29) Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: What we learn from this passage is the fact that when Lot was brought out of Sodom, that’s a picture of the rapture. You find two angels going into Sodom which represents the world and bringing the believer out before the wrath of God is poured out on the city. The book of Revelation teaches the same thing. The Bible tells in the book of Revelation the Lord Jesus Christ sends his angels and gathers the believers and brings them out of the world. The book of Revelation specifically tells us that a half hour goes by and then He begins to pour out his wrath. \r\n\r\nScene 12 - Description of the Rapture \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: This “Left Behind” model where everybody disappears and everybody is saying, “Where are they all?” That’s not what people are going to be saying. Because the Bible says that the same day that we are going to be taken, God is going to begin to pour out judgment. God is going to begin to rain fire and brimstone on this earth. People are going to know that something is happening. People are going to be running for cover. People are going to be asking the rocks to fall on them and to hide them because of the fire, the brimstone, the wrath that’s going to be coming. The same day that we are taken out of here is the same day that God is going to begin to pour out his wrath. That’s why when the sun and moon are darkened the Bible says the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand? Because that same day, a half hour later, God begins to rain fire and brimstone. So chapter six of Revelation, the sun and moon are darkened. Chaper seven, the great multitude of believers appears in heaven. Chapter eight, he begins to pour out his wrath. It’s exactly what the Bible teaches in Matthew 24. Sun and moon darkened, then the rapture. It’s that simple. I talk to people who believe in the pre-trib rapture and they will usually tell me either one of two things. They will either tell me that the rapture is not even mentioned in the book of Revelation which is a pretty strange thing to say since the book of Revelation covers in such great detail the events of the end times. To leave out an event as significant as Jesus Christ coming in the clouds and all the believers of all the ages being caught up together with him in the clouds…that’s such a major event. To say that it’s not mentioned at all in the book of Revelation, that it doesn’t happen at all in the book of Revelation, is unthinkable. But because it’s so ridiculous to say that the rapture is not found in the book of Revelation at all, a lot of pre-trib people have tried to search for it and find something that they could use as the rapture that is before the tribulation, and here is what I keep hearing over and over again – Revelation 4:1. Revelation 4:1 says: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 4:1) After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: So this is a voice like a trumpet. There’ s no trumpet in this verse that is speaking and saying to John (singular, one person), “Come up hither and I will show THEE things which must be hereafter.” And they will say, “See, that’s the rapture right there.” One guy being caught up. They will say that’s the rapture. What’s ridiculous about this is that they don’t even read verse 2. Because in verse number 2 it says: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 4:2) And immediately I was in the spirit, and , behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: The rapture is not a spirit going up into heaven. The rapture is a bodily resurrection. We are going to be caught up physically into the air. This isn’t just some kind of thing where our spirit goes up. The Bible is clear that the rapture is a literal, bodily resurrection of the dead in Christ which shall rise first. We which are alive and remain are going to be caught up together with him bodily. So this spiritual catching up of one person, John, is definitely not the rapture. And if you think that this is the rapture, you’re taking a really loose interpretation. It’s funny because people I talk to who believe in the pre-tribulation rapture claim to interpret the Bible literally. Yet when you ask them to show you the rapture in Revelation, they will take you to Revelation 4:1. One guy being taken up to heaven. They don’t even read to verse 2 when he says, “And immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven.” He didn’t even physically go up. His body was still there on the Isle of Patmos. The dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds. This isn’t just some kind of a spiritual occurrence. This is a physical occurrence. That’s quite a stretch to say that that’s the rapture. Those who believe in a pre-tribulation rapture have to say that Revelation 4:1 is the rapture because that’s the only thing that they can even find in the book of Revelation before the tribulation. And it just doesn’t fit. They had to find something, I guess. I grew up being taught the pre-tribulation rapture . When I was going up, I was taught that it is never mentioned in the book of Revelation. I always thought there was something fishy about that. An event as important and as major as the rapture…You’ve got a book about end times prophecy, the book of Revelation, and he just doesn’t mention it? It doesn’t make any sense. I was always taught as a kid that the rapture would be where you’re just going about your life and all of a sudden you just disappear. But it’s so much greater than that, because the Bible says every eye shall see him. We’re going to see the sun and moon darkened. It says in Luke 21 that when you see these things begin to come to pass, he said look up, for your redemption draweth nigh. Imagine what it’s going to be like at that moment when the sun goes dark, the moon goes dark, the stars being to fall, and we look up just knowing this is it. It’s here. We’ve made it. \r\n\r\nKent Hovind: It’s sort of like a Hollywood entrance. Have you ever watched the famous people come into anyplace. They always have the lights flash and the cannons boom and the smoke and everything else. They want to impress people. “Hey, look at me.” If you read Revelation chapter 6 or Matthew 24, Mark 13, or Luke 21, any of the passages that describe the sun and moon going dark, it’s really amazing when you look at it. The sun and the moon go dark which is going to get just about everybody’s attention on earth. But it also says there is an earthquake, so in case you’re blind, it’s still going to get your attention. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: And then at that moment of total darkness, Jesus Christ comes in the clouds, lights up the whole sky. The Bible says he will light up the sky like the lightning where it shines from one end of heaven to another, and we will look up and we will see Jesus Christ coming in the clouds. We will know at any moment we are about to be caught up to be with him. I hope that I live to see that day. I don’t know if this is going to happen in our lifetime. I hope that this happens in my lifetime. I hope I can endure that persecution and tribulation. What an awesome thing it would be to be alive on that day when Jesus Christ comes in the clouds. It’s so much greater than we’ve been led to believe. \r\n\r\nKent Hovind: The idea that there is going to be a secret second coming where people have to later find out what happened is just not true. It’s going to get everybody’s attention with this grand Hollywood opening. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: You’re exactly right. In Revelation Chapter 1 it says “Behold, he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him.” Notice that “cometh” is in present tense. That’s the next time he comes. He’s coming with clouds and every eye shall see him. It’s pretty clear. To the unsaved this is going to scare them to death. The Bible says that when they see him coming in the clouds, they’re going to be mourning, they’re going to be weeping, they’re going to be scared to death. But for those of us that look for his appearing, we’re going to be excited, we’re going to be thrilled, and it’s going to be an amazing feeling to know this is it. \r\n\r\nScene 13 - Conclusion \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: I personally want this film to be successful. I would love for this film to be able to be used of God to open people’s eyes to the truth. I just think it’s so important if we can get back to the Bible. I remember when I was a teenager and I was growing up, I didn’t even like reading the book of Revelation just because I thought I couldn’t understand it or everytime I was reading something I questioned whether, “Does it actually say that? Does it actually mean that?” When I was able to learn the truth about the rapture, it just opened up the scriptures to me. I love reading the book of Revelation now. As I go through it, it just makes so much sense. I just think that if we can reach out to the movement of Christianity out there, to the movement of fundamentalism, to the movement of Baptists out there, and we could open their eyes to this issue, then maybe it would bring a love of the word of God and a revival of the word of God and a revival of studying the word of God back to the pulpits of our country, and we could really see a great work done for God. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: The reason that we made this film is not to split doctrinal hairs or just to correct someone whose view of Bible prophecy is a little bit different than ours. That’s not the point. These events are real events that will take place. The Bible tells us there WILL be a one world government. There WILL be a one world religion. There WILL be a one world currency. This isn’t just a conspiracy theory that people can brush off. These events are really going to happen. People are going to be killed in mass numbers. There’s going to be famine. There’s going to be pestilence. There’s going to be persecution. It’s going to be unlike anything that this world has ever been through and Christians are not prepared for it at all. Because they’ve believed in this fairytale of the pre-tribulation rapture. I believe in the rapture. It’s a Biblical doctrine. But the rapture comes AFTER the tribulation. \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: You say, “Pastor Jimenez, why does this matter?” Here’s why it matters. The pre-tribulation rapture is a doctrine that I believe it doesn’t really much matter what we do. Because no matter what, either I’m going to die in peace as an old man or I’m just going to be going through life, taking my vacations, investing in my 401k, living the good life, and one day I’m just going to disappear, before anything bad happens. This teaching being taught to millions of people I believe has caused us to become very lazy and very satisfied in our Christianity. We need to preach the gospel. We need to get out there. We have to educate people and tell them, “Look, there’s persecution coming. Go on your little vacation and do all the things you’ve got to do, but you better strengthen your inner man. You better get in your Bible. You better start learning the Bible. You better start walking with God and knowing God. You better start reading the Bible, because there might be a day when they take this Bible away from you.” Today we’re given complete freedom to gather together, to open the Bible, to preach the word, but there might come a day when this assembly would be illegal, when this Bible would be illegal, when doing what we’re doing now would be illegal. If we would have a heart for God, we would reach people with the gospel of Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: All that to say this. These things have I preached unto you that you might not be offended. When persecution comes, when you’re asked to take the mark of the beast in your right hand or in your forehead, you’ll remember this sermon. Maybe it won’t happen in our lifetime, maybe it will. But if it does, you’ll remember this sermon. That’s why Jesus said it and that’s why I’m saying it. You say, “Is this to scare us?” No, the Bible says in the world ye shall have tribulation. Get upset about it? No. He said in the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. “I’ve overcome the world.” Cheer up. Don’t be down. Don’t walk out of the sermon, “Oh, man, are you serious? Beheadings? Prison? Famine? Pestilence? Are you serious?” No, be of good cheer. He’s overcome the world. Maybe it will happen in our lifetime, maybe it won’t. But either way, if God be for us, who can be against us? Praise Jesus Christ. Let’s bow our heads and have a word of prayer. Father, we thank you so much for the clear truth in your word and we thank you so much for giving us the Holy Spirit to guide us. I couldn’t have figured this stuff out on my own with all the brainwashing I received from these people lying to me and Scofield, but thank you for the Holy Spirit that in that room so many years ago cut through all that and burned these three words into my mind. These three words just burned into my mind from Matthew 24 as a 12 year old boy: AFTER THE TRIBULATION. I pray that those words would sink into the hearts and minds of every person who is here tonight. We love you and thank you and in Jesus’s name we pray, amen. Let’s sing one quick song before we go. \r\n\r\nCREDITS \r\n\r\nMUSIC: It Is Well With My Soul \r\n\r\nPastor Jimenez: This is my favorite song, and we’re going to sing my favorite verse right now. A lot of times when you’re singing songs, you just start singing. You don’t really think about the words and what it’s saying. Look at the third verse of this song. It says, “My sin, oh, the bliss, of this glorious thought.” You say, “Well, what’s the bliss about thinking about my sin?” But look at what it says. It says, “It’s nailed to the cross and I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O, my soul.” Just think about those words as you’re singing it. Sing it out, and we’ll get ready for this preaching. \r\n\r\nMy sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!\r\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\r\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\r\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! \r\n\r\nIt is well, with my soul,\r\nIt is well, it is well, with my soul. \r\n\r\nAnd Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,\r\nThe clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\r\nThe trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,\r\nEven so, it is well with my soul. \r\n\r\nIt is well, with my soul,\r\nIt is well, it is well, with my soul. \r\n\r\nTHE BIBLE WAY TO HEAVEN by Pastor Steven Anderson \r\n\r\nThe Bible is really clear on salvation. It’s not based on how good you are. A lot of people think they are pretty good and they are going to get to heaven because they are pretty good. But the Bible says, “For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” The Bible says, “As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one.” I’m not righteous. You’re not righteous. And if it were our goodness that would get us in to heaven, none of us would be going. \r\n\r\n1. Admit you are a sinner. \r\n\r\nThe Bible even says in Revelation 21:8: \r\n\r\n(Revelation 21:8) But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolators, and [listen to this] – ALL liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. \r\n\r\nI’ve lied before. Everybody has lied before. We’ve all sinned, and we’ve done stuff worse than lying. Let’s face it. We all deserve hell. \r\n\r\n2. Realize the penalty for sin. \r\n\r\nBut the Bible says: \r\n\r\n(Romans 5:8) But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. \r\n\r\nSo Jesus Christ, because he loves us, came to this earth. The Bible says he was God manifest in the flesh. God basically took on human form. He lived a sinless life. He did not commit any sin. Of course, they beat Him and spit on Him and nailed Him to the cross. The Bible says that when He was on that cross, He Himself bare our sins in His own body on the tree. So every sin you’ve ever done, any sin I’ve ever done, it was as if Jesus had done it. He was being punished for our sins. Of course, they took His body when he died and they buried it in the tomb, and His soul went down to hell for three days and three nights (Acts 2:31). Three days later, He rose again from the dead. He showed unto the disciples the holes in His hands. The Bible is really clear that Jesus did die for everybody. It says that He died not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world. But there is something that we must do to be saved. The Bible has that question in Acts 16: What must I do to be saved? They said: \r\n\r\n(Acts 16:30-31) Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.” \r\n\r\nAnd that’s it. He didn’t say, “Join a church and you will be saved. Get baptized and you will be saved. Live a good life and you will be saved. Repent of all your sins and you will be saved.” No. He said, “Believe.” \r\n\r\n3. Believe that Jesus died, was buried, and rose again for you. \r\n\r\nEven the most famous verse in the whole Bible, that is written on the bottom of the cup in an OutBurger, it is so famous everybody has heard of it: John 3:16:\r\n\r\n(John 3:16) For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. \r\n\r\nEverlasting means everlasting. It means forever. Jesus said: \r\n\r\n(John 10:28) And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. \r\n\r\nThe Bible says in John 6:47: \r\n\r\n(John 6:47) Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. \r\n\r\nSo if you believe on Jesus Christ, that Bible says that you have everlasting life. You are going to live forever. You can’t lose your salvation. It’s eternal. It’s everlasting. Once you are saved, once you believe on Him, you are saved forever and no matter what, you can never lose your salvation. Even if I were to go out and commit some awful sin, God will punish me for it on this earth. If I went out and killed somebody today, God is going to make sure that I get punished. I’m going to prison or far worse or I will get the death penalty, or whatever this earth punishes me with. God is going to make sure I’m going to get punished even more. But I’m not going to hell. There’s nothing I could do to go to hell because I’m saved. And if I went to hell, God lied, because He promised that whoever believeth in Him has everlasting life. He said: \r\n\r\n(John 11:26) And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. \r\n\r\nThat’s why there are a lot of examples of people in the Bible who did some really bad stuff, yet they made it to heaven. How? Because they were so good? No. It’s because they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. Their sins are forgiven. Other people who may have lived a better life in the world’s eyes, or maybe even really they lived a better life, but they don’t believe in Christ, they are going to have to go to hell to be punished for their sins. \r\n\r\n4. Trust Christ alone as your savior. \r\n\r\nAnd let me just close on this one thought, one thing that I wanted to be sure to bring up today. There was a question that was asked to Jesus by one of his disciples. That question was this: Are there few that be saved? That’s a good question, right? Are most people saved? Or is it few that are saved? Who here thinks that most people in this world are going to heaven? Guess what the answer was? He said in Matthew 7: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 7:13-14) Enter ye in at the straight gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. \r\n\r\nThen he went on to say this: \r\n\r\n(Matthew 7:21-23) Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, the majority of this world doesn’t even claim to believe in Jesus. Thankfully, the majority of this classroom claims to believe in Jesus. But the majority of the world does not claim to believe in Jesus. But God warned that even amongst those who claim to believe in Jesus, even amongst those who call him Lord, many will be saying to him, “We did all these wonderful works. Why aren’t we saved?” He’s going to say, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” That’s because salvation is not by works. And if you are trusting your own works to save you, if you think you’re going to heaven because you’ve been baptized, or if you think “Well, I think you have to live a good life. I think you have to keep the commandments to be saved. I think you have to go to church. I think you’ve got to turn from your sins…” If you’re trusting in your works, Jesus is going to say to you one day, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” You have to have all your faith in what he did. You have to put your faith in what Jesus did on the cross, when he died for you and was buried and rose again. That’s your ticket into heaven. If you’re trusting, “Oh, I’m going to heaven because I’m such a good Christian and I do all these wonderful things,” he’s going to say, “Depart from me.” And notice what He said: “Depart from me, I NEVER knew you.” Not, “I used to know you.” Because once He knows you, as I mentioned earlier, it’s everlasting. It’s eternal. Once He knows you, you’re saved forever. But He’s going to say, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” If you go to hell, it’s because He never knew you. Once He knows you, He knows you. It’s just like how my children will always be my children. When you’re born again, when you’re His child, you will always be His child. You may be the black sheep of the family. You may be somebody who gets disciplined by God heavily on this earth. You can screw up your life down here, but you can’t screw that up. You’re saved. It’s a done deal. So, that’s the main thing that I wanted to present to you about the end times. And we do have just a few minutes for questions about either salvation or about the end times. \r\n\r\nDear Jesus, I know that I am a sinner. I know that I deserve to go to hell, but I believe you died on the cross for me and rose again. Please save me right now and give me eternal life. I’m only trusting in you, Jesus. Amen.

They will burn that way. This is what God says. \r\n\r\nAudience:\tYeah. That's right. Amen. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tLet us help you. Lets stop cursing the darkness and start shining the light. For free assistance email us at gethelp@bornthatway.org. Thank you. \r\n\r\nS.M. Davis:\tLet me encourage you to get the book "Born That Way After All" and read it. You can also read many outstanding articles on Brother Nixon's website which is BornThatWay.org. \r\n\r\nBob Gray Sr:\tThat is exactly how I feel about the author, and my friend, Johnny Nixon in Born That Way Ministries. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson:\tBorn That Way Ministries, just by the name, you can tell there's something wrong with this ministry. Born That Way Ministry, the book that it centers around is called "Born That Way After All." \r\n\r\nPastor Berzins:\tWhat do you think when you see ... Here is the book. It's called "Born That Way After All." What are you going to think that's about? Who is the one pushing the "Oh, we're born that way." We're born ... Who says that? It's the queer community. It's the sodomites. They're the ones that are making the claim. "Oh, we're born this way." \r\n\r\nFemale:\tI am gay. I was born gay. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tPeople born gay \r\n\r\nfemale 2:\tOur new question. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\t[inaudible 00:02:28] probably \r\n\r\nSpeaker 4:\tJust put your paws up because you were born this way baby. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tThey're the ones that have been pushing, born that way, born that way, trying to get you to accept that this is the way that we are born. This is the way God made us. This is natural. This is normal because we were born that way and they come out with a book that says "born that way afterall" you're confirming that's true. Yes, they are born that way afterall and they say, oh that's not really what we're saying. Then why did you name your book that. Shouldn't we abstain from all appearance of evil, first of all but then they're spinned when you read the book \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson:\tThey're teaching that the homosexuals were born that way. But they weren't born to be homosexuals. They were actually born to be eunuchs and they are just confused. That's all, they're just so little mixed up. What it is, is that God just didn't give these men desire for women because he just wanted them to be just be fully dedicated to him so they're suppose to be just be celibates. They're born to be celibates and they just accidentally became a homo. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tso if a person is born and doesn't have a desire for that which God created him to have a desire for. Pray, tell me, why he have a desire for a safety tank. If he doesn't desire that which God created, which is perfect and fit for him, he designed for him, it fits like a cloth for him but he wants to play in a safety tank. Do you see the stupidity in this nonsense. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tSo if you've got the book, I just want to show you some excerpts from this book, just to show you what it's about. Why am I attracted to the same sex? This is the question I'm asked by many eunuchs. \r\n\r\nPastor Anderson:\tthe reason why you're asked that question by some many eunuchs is because they're not eunuchs. They're sodomites, okay. They are homos but his whole book is based on the fact that these people are actually born eunuchs and what that means to him is that they're born without any attraction towards men or women and then somehow they just accidentally end up being a sodomite. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tThe guy he toils around with is this flaming and feminine queer that he brings along with him. The book centers around this guy, okay. \r\n\r\nThis guy, leaning to just a full blown sodomite lifestyle. Just having relationships with multitudes of men and it was all because he was just confused. He didn't realize he's just a eunuch. \r\n\r\nHere's why that's so stupid. Because if you're supposedly a eunuch then you wouldn't be desirous of men or women. You desire neither. That's the whole point of God saying, you know, some people are going to remain single. First of all when he talks about people remaining single. He's not saying they have no desire for the opposite gender. He's just saying that they're able to contain that desire but what they're teaching is that "well these people are just born with no desire for men or a woman and so the obvious question is, well then, why are they being a fag then. It doesn't even make sense because if you desire neither then you just do neither. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tAnd they say "no [inaudible 00:05:54] people they are born eunuchs" which means they don't have a desire for people the opposite gender. They were born that way by God and somehow they got confused and then they are now doing provactive acts with some of the same gender just because they don't have any type of sexual attraction to anybody. Does that make any sense? \r\n\r\nAudience:\tNo. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tDon't say that somehow a person is going to get confused and do something repulsive and do something that's going to turn the stomach of any normal person naturally because these sins, they won't deny it, the sin of homosexuality is against nature. It's not against nature for some. It's against nature for all. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tNo man just accidentally ends up with another dude because he had no desire. That's stupidity. That's foolishness. The bible says that further foolishness is sin, how much more when you speak that kind of foolishness. They're trying to convince us that homos are actually eunuchs. I mean, what do they think of next. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tWhy am I attracted to the same sex? This is a question I'm asked by many eunuchs. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tOf course that's weird to think that a eunuch would be attracted to same sex because a eunuch is not a sodomite. He says, number one: it's inherent. \r\n\r\nSame sex attraction. Same sex attraction is not exclusive. We all possess it. How do like this quote. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tThis leads me to conclude that we should have biblical eunuchs of both sex as in our churches that interact with the kids. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tSo he wants dudes who are attracted to the same sex working with our kids. He wants to bring them in as the children's worker. That's always been the goal of this movement. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tThe end game for the sodomites is that this ministry basically provides for them the ability to be able to get access to children and that's why they have an article that says, seven things you don't know about eunuchs, like even mind they're not using the google definition of eunuch. When they say eunuch, they mean, seven things you don't know about a filthy animal, sodomite, homo, that's what they mean. In their "seven things you don't know about fags" is what they really mean here and the first thing that they say is this, they say, number one: You can trust them. And then later on in the article, what they say is this, and by the way, they are excellent working with children. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tTake the sodomites, right. They don't believe that the sodomites are reprobates so they are saying we can reach the sodomites and get them to a life of celibacy and then they make great children's workers. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tTypically, they love working with other people and can be trusted to care for them. They are usually excellent working with children, so there you have it folks. That is the real end game here of the sodomites creeping into churches. Why are they infiltrating? Why are they creeping in? Well, to gain access to children. Isn't interesting that born that way ministries just brings up, number one: oh, you can trust this person. Then right after that, follows it up with, oh, they're great working with children so basically, they want to just enable pedophiles to have access to children. That's how wicked this is. That's how satan ... don't tell me I'm overreacting. These people have truly known the depths of satan. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tIt's so crazy I won't even bring it up except I'm talking about big named creatures are ... just embracing this lizard. The supporting minister there, if you go their bornthatway.org their supporting ministries, who supports them. This is what it says on the top of the page. The pastors and organizations listed below are friends who understand the truth. Talking about the truth that they are teaching that sodomites are really just poor little confused eunuchs. The pastors and organizations listed below are friends who understand the truth and provide a safe place for those seeking answers. By the way, those seeking answers are pedophiles and sodomites. Who they are painting as victims whereas the bible paints them as wicked proud beast haters of God, full of murder, debate, deceit, malignity, read Romans:1. \r\n\r\nHere's some of the names on the list: Dr. Bob Gray from long view, Texas. He's the leader of the independent fundamental baptist movement. There are hundreds of pastors. Hundreds of independent baptist pastors who look up to Dr. Bob Gray Sr. As the leader of the fundamental baptist movement. This is what he's supporting, born that way ministries. Dr Jeff Orleans. Again, another big name in fundamental zone that people look to as the leader of the fundamental baptist movement. Aslam Davis is another well known guy that's on here. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tSeveral months now, a pastor friend read what I had written down. I'm not a heterosexual. He became very concerned. I was scheduled to preach in his church and he thought that maybe Johnny Nixon had come out of his closet and become a homosexual. May I assure you that I'm not homosexual. In fact the truth is this, I'm not a heterosexual and neither are you. I'm not a homosexual and neither are you. There are no heterosexuals. There are no homosexuals. They never have been. They never will be. And the whole gay marriage tobacco will continue to get worse and freedom of religion in America may die completely unless every bible believer in America starts saying what I am saying right now. Let me encourage you to get the book, born that way afterall and read it. You can also read many outstanding articles on brother Nixon's website which is bornthatway.org. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tAnd this website, born that way ministries is so soft on homos. It literally says that calling yourselves straight is offensive. Because if you say that you're straight. You're applying that they are crooked. But you know, I got news for you. The bible has\r\n\r\na lot worse things to say about sodomites than just that they're crooked. The bible calls them, filthy, beast, vile, sons of the devil, everything else so this website is so soft on sodomy and literally says, don't call yourselves straight. So Bob Gray has come out supporting this ministry. Bob Gray Snr, from long view, Texas. He came out supporting this ministry and he even put up in his blog post. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tThis is what Bob Gray said "I'm not a heterosexual, okay because that's what this born that way ministry teaches, to not say that you're straight. To not say that you're heterosexual. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tAnd Dr. Gray said he re-read the book and he said in his blog post, he said he was sitting on a plane, he re-read the book, he was amazed at the truth in the book. What Bob Gray Snr. Is doing is an abomination to God. Put that in your stick and type and smoke it. He's leading people away into the others listening to the pastors who go over that wicked book, born that way after all. It's so bad, it's not even funny. I couldn't believe what they were saying and that Bob Gray, just read the book, read the book. You know what that tells me that he has read the book and he's okay with it. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tLet me show you this part on here. This is a page on cross dressing. Let's read some of these. Gender dysphoria or childhood gender non conformity is a condition in which children and teens do not conform to expected societal behavior. Some signs and traits of this condition include: cross gender clothing and grooming preferences. Typical among those who are diagnosed includes a fascination with the clothing of the opposite sex. Even though, this sometimes leads to a desire for cross dressing, it's well reported that over 75% of these individuals identify themselves as heterosexuals. Among the many major studies in this area, gender dysphoria is accepted by many medical professionals to be but physiologically and psychologically. Medical research also indicates that gender non-conforming behaviors are relatively treatable such as testosterone deficiency or congenial adrenal hyperplasia. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tso basically, he goes on and on about cross dressing as it's a condition. Though it's a condition or those who have been diagnosed with it, is a condition. He's trying to make it out that it's a medical problem, okay. It's funny because in all these talk about cross dressing, he never tells us what the bible says. Here's the one verse in the bible that talks about cross dressing. It says, the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are abomination to the Lord thy God. Notice, that does not say as people often quote this. That it is an abomination to cross dress. It actually says that if you cross dress, you are an abomination for all that do so are an abomination to the Lord thy God. Man's wisdom over here of the world says, "it's just a medical condition" over here it says, no, the problem is, the person doing it, is an abomination. But he doesn't even bring up the relevant scripture. Look what he says next. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tThese are real world issues that are prevalent in our society today. You may recall a male celebrity athlete announcing to the world that he felt that he was truly a female. How did you respond? Many Christians voiced their opinion about his confession in a rather questionable manner. People that suffer with transgender related issues should not be maligned or mocked. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tSo notice what he says, they're suffering with transgenderism so the bible says, they're an abomination. John Nixon says, "they are victims, they're suffering" and he's talking about Bruce Jenner here whose picture in drag, cross dress, was on the cover of the magazine that was seen by literally over a billion people. It was everywhere, in the airport, in the grocery store, everywhere you looked. You saw that filthy picture, your children were exposed to it and instead of getting angry and being upset about the fact that this sodomite put his dirty picture in the minds of half of our planet. He's worried about, "but how did you respond? Many Christians ..." shut up, I don't care what you think about how Christians acted, that's a filthy picture and he's not suffering, he's not diagnosed, he's an abomination. Friend, if you're at home and you don't agree with me, just remember, you don't agree with God. This is God's word. This is not my word. This is the devil's lies over here. \r\n\r\nOne of the most telling things about this book is what it doesn't say. Just like it doesn't bring out Deuteronomy 22:5, it also conveniently never references Romans 1, where it talks about God giving them over to vile affections. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tFor this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections. For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the women. Burned in their lust, one towards another, men with men, working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence in their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge. God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient.\r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tHe doesn't even bring that ... in the whole book, talking about how sodomites got that way, that's what the whole book is about. Born that way. Is a whole book about how sodomites got that way. He convinently never brings up that God gave them up under vile affections. That's why the women changed the natural use. That was easy and likewise also the men. So God gave them up to vile affections. God gave them up to uncleanliness through the lust of their own heart, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient. He just never even mentions that in a whole book about how they got that way because you know, most of them assures that they're born eunuchs which is not logical because if you are a eunuch and you have no attraction to either agenda and that's his weird definition to be eunuch and then you wouldn't be with other dudes as a man or with other women as a woman. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tThe perverted community that we have seen a lot of our eunuchs go to ... they are still natural eunuchs. I mean, they were created special, however they don't know about it yet so we've got to let them know that they do have a purpose in life. \r\n\r\nSpeaker7:\tThat comes to the heart of my question is that, you believe that the people who are driven to this or drawn to same sex relationships were actually eunuchs.\r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tThe majority.\r\n\r\nSpeaker7:\tSo what percentage would you say of these, you know what ... can you put a figure on it. You say majority. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tYeah. If I gave a figure, it'd probably be ridiculous because it would be 99% because we have met very few people who do not see themselves as natural eunuchs, who are in the lifestyle. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tI must make it clear that not every one who engages in unnatural behavior was born to be a eunuch, most of those with whom I've met has been eunuchs but there are those who merely have allowed their lust to consume them and lead them into this sinful activity. So basically saying that not all homos were born eunuchs. Some people just went into that for other reasons but he's claiming that most of the homos that he's run into were eunuchs. I mean this is insane. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tHe even gives an example of his poster child saying the poster child eunuch that his God who has recruited in the bar by another homo. This is some guy who was supposed to be born a eunuch and he was ostracized and didn't feel like he fit in and he found acceptance in the homosexual community so that's why he just accidentally became a homosexual. He just accidentally started burning for other men and ... but anyway he's at this bar and he's recruited by these homos. He even said that, when Sam was recruited, the homo that recruited Sam ... he tells a story of how he picked him up in the bar and all those kind of stuff. He goes on and say, this is what baffles me the most, he goes on and say, the homo that recruited him, he may sound sinister but he was not sinister. He said he was just a confused eunuch also. This guy is probably just a confused eunuch. \r\n\r\nThis is a homo who is in a bar playing on other people. He's preying and recruiting and picking to ... oh, he's just a confused eunuch. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tSo he got confused, he got backslidden, he got out of church. He went off to college and while he's in college, this other guy invites him to a bar and when he gets to the bar. That other guy is with a few other friends from college and says to him, " hey, we believe you're gay and we're gay too" and he basically tells Sam, " I want to have intercourse with you. I'm here to confront you because I'm a homo and I think you're homo too. I want to have intercourse with you too" and then Sam, at that moment, that's like the most accepted he's ever felt. \r\n\r\nFor the first time, he feels loved and accepted so he has intercourse with the guy. That's what the book is about. And of course you know this is the guy who Johnny Nixon pulls him out of that and makes him into a celibate eunuch, a children's worker. That's what he transforms him into. It would be easy for us to think that the motives of the young man who approached Sam were in some way sinister. I prefer to think he's probably just another Sam [inaudible 00:21:55] so even the guy who recruited Sam into a full blown sodomite [inaudible 00:22:01] even the guy who sort him out, brought him to a bar, ganged up on him with other sodomites, of course putting alcohol in him, you think that's a coincidence that he approached him with this in a bar. \r\n\r\nThe bible says, woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink and put it inside bottle to him and maketh him drunk and also that thy mayst look on their nakedness. In Habakkuk 2:15, all the pronouns are male pronouns. It's a dude giving another dude alcohol to look on that dude's nakedness. Habakkuk 2:15 is referring to homos giving alcohols to other homos to look on their nakedness but according to Nixon. That is in no way sinister. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tIt would be easy for us to think that the motives of the young one who approached Sam were in som way sinister. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tHe's saying that they weren't sinister at all. He's just another confused eunuch [inaudible 00:22:52] so even just the sodomites recruiters who are taking people who have never done it and enticing them into that lifestyle through alcohol. They're not even sinister. They are just victims of gender non-conformity disorder, we just haven't diagnosed them [inaudible 00:23:13] \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tEunuch is just [inaudible 00:23:14] of sodomites. I'll proof it to you because he says that most homosexuals are just eunuchs. So eunuchs is just his word for sodomites. Any time I say eunuchs, you might just feel in the blank, just sodomites. He says that one of the ways you can tell a eunuch is if they're flamboyant and fashion conscious. He's trying to say that they're eunuchs because God created them that way. So he is saying that God created them with a flamboyance and fashion conscience. Now I've got a word for that if you're a man and you're into name brands other than [inaudible 00:23:54] and dickens and levers and you are fashion conscious and you're flamboyant, I got a word for that. It's called a feminine, it's called a sissy and God says as that's a sin. So why would God create somebody who is just a [inaudible 00:24:07] purpose is suppose to serve God but now they're just Mr. Fashion Police. They're just Mr. Into the latest greatest fashions and flamboyance and name brand. Why is God going to create somebody for that nonsense, that's a sin. He said most homos are eunuchs. Now just think about the nonsense of these. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tSo this chapter right here has to do with how to identify this eunuchs in your church. He said that this people that God created with no desire sexually for either men or women is wonderful, special servants of God that God created, that they were born that way. He tells you, that these are some signals to look for or identify these special eunuchs so you can help them counsel them. Does he sometimes exhibit flamboyance? One characteristic many eunuchs have which is often seen in the so called homosexual lifestyles is a combination of quiet nobility and flamboyance. They like flashy colors and enjoy the things that we may often equate with femininity, all the touchy, feeling individuals and then he says appearances is important to him. Does he desire to be seen as lovely. Does he like to wear bright clothing and colors that are more often associated with women. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tA eunuch maybe is strikingly fashion conscious. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tPhysical appearance is extremely important to them. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tSo, the thing that is so weird about this is that he literally is trying to expect us to believe that the fact that God supposedly made these men to be special, distracted servants of him that don't get married and just a fully dedicated to him. So why will would God create them fashion conscious. Can you explain that to me? So, born that way afterall. He really were to be born to be fashion conscious. I mean, what is this guy's favorite tv show? Clear eye for the straight guy- \r\n\r\nSpeaker 8:\tIf person is naturally more prone to a same sex fact relationship. And I would say, yes, it has to do with what you talked about this morning. It has to do with intimacy. All of us had this intimacy when we were young especially guys. We lived to be around our friends until something happened with some of us. A part of that intimacy which is not sexual closeness reverts over to the females. Well guess what, it never reverted for the natural eunuch. He has more of a desire for intimacy and closeness than we do and a part of that, believe it or not, revolves around touch. We, as human beings are perfected by touch. Like Jesus and John, when John and Jesus touched each other. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tTwo eunuchs and remember this is his code word for basically men who are attracted to other men. Men who formally have had sex with other men. Two eunuchs of the same sex can develop wonderful and chased relationship with one another that is in no way sexual or romantic.\r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tTwo eunuch men or women can live together in chastity as long as they remain mentally pure and avoid any appearance of evil. So basically, these formal sodomites that he wants to bring in. These men who are attracted to other men that he claims who are born that way because they were born eunuchs, he wants to bring them in, make them children's workers and he's even saying they can live with another eunuch dude so these two couple of queers basically, he calls them eunuchs but he's talking about men who lust after other men, can live together, be in church, living together with their partner.\r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tBut just as long as they're celibates, as long as they're chase, you know \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tand how are we going to know that. We're suppose to just take their word for it that they are celibates now as they live with their gay buddy, okay. You can develop strong emotional same sex ties but it may be wise not to share a living place or to show open affection too often. It might be wise not to if people are freaking out and don't show open affection too often. He's talking about your eunuch same sex partner that you live with. What does the bible say, the bibl says, a man leaves father and mother and cleaves to his wife, the two shall be one flesh and of course there's also the option given of a man just remaining single like the apostle Paul and other people in the bible who remained single. Nobody is teaching that people have to get married. That's a [inaudible 00:28:53]. First Corinthians 7 talks about how you don't have to get married if you don't want to. If you can handle being single and serve God, great. But he wants his people living with heir eunuch body and he says, don't show open affection too often so save all the cuddling with your eunuch body. Save that for behind closed doors, just don't do it openly too often. Sometimes do it openly, but not too often and you may not want to share a living place if it's going to offend people. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\t\r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tI believe there's a conspiracy today in the independent fundamental baptist movement to bring these sons of [inaudible 00:29:34] into churches. So here's what Johnny Nixon and his partner Joshua Argon ... you know they decided, hey let's make a ministry where we trick all these pastors to go out and purposely look for perverts and bring them in and let's teach them ... the number one thing you need to know about these people is that you can trust them with your children, put them in the Sunday school class by themselves. You know, with Johnny Nixon, Joshua and who ever, you know. Put them in there because you can trust them and the best place they are excellent, they're excellent [inaudible 00:30:16] \r\n\r\nSpeaker7:\tThey're trying to sneak these people in by calling them eunuchs and they're saying in English, bring these homos in, let's just teach them that, hey, you're not gay after all. You're not a homo. You're just born a eunuch and that you should have no desire or the opposite sex in here. Let's just bring them in and we'll let you work with the children. Listen, that is sick. That is disgusting. Listen, we need to guard our children and the reason why I'm preaching all these this morning and preaching so hard against it, is out of love for the people of this church and out of love for children because I'm not going to let some molester, child molester, rapist, some homo come in here and do things against your child. They're not welcome and this church. Do you hear me? \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tThis gets me real fired up when I hear this dumb argument. It blows me away. Here's the argument. We do background checks in our church. I mean it's just ... " we do background check" okay but did you know that the average pedophile molests 260 victims in his lifetime. Now, if they are getting arrested every time they do it or most of the time they do it or even a tenth of the time they do it. They wouldn't get to 260 victims. You now how they get to 260 victims because they molest scores of victims before getting caught. Usually when you hear about these pedophiles getting caught, it's like 20 years later. It's like, oh, 20 years ago he molested this person and then they came out and then 12 other victims came out. Isn't there always just a whole line of victims they come out. Oh, what, she came forward, 10 other people came forward and it's 15 years ago, 17 years ago. How in the world can an average pedophile molest 26 victims unless they're getting away with it all the time so you know what, that background check tells you nothing. It just tells you they haven't been caught yet. It doesn't guarantee it. \r\n\r\nEverybody does it for the first time. Think about that. Every murderer kills their first person. Every thief steals something for the first time. Every drunk took their first drink, right and every pedophile molested a kid for the first time. "Oh, but the background check is clean" yeah that's because eight years later, they are going get caught and then it's too late once lives have been destroyed. Once irreparable damage is done, the baby is [inaudible 00:32:58] then it's like, oh, turns out this guy was a pervert. A homo is [inaudible 00:33:05]to a pedophile as a puppy is a dog. If a homo is not a pedophile. It's just because he hasn't mature to be a full grown beast yet. Is just because he hasn't any opportunity yet. He hasn't had the opportunity to recruit a child. Now I'm going to proof to you that homos is a pedophiles. First point, the way I'm going to proof to you homos are pedophiles are the cries of sodom. And the Lord said, because the cries of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sentence is very grievous, I would go down now and see what they've done altogether according to their [inaudible 00:33:41]. So whose cries do you think I was hearing. Whose cries from sodom did grasp the attention of the Lord Jesus Christ. The bible says the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight. \r\n\r\nthe Lord is far from the wicked but he hears the prayers of the righteous so do you think it was the wicked people in sodom that Jesus Christ came down to answer their prayers because he heard their prayers. No. It's the chosen that these crude beast are messing with. It's the chosen, that they are wreaking and they are crying out their lives, oh, Jesus help me. A dog has got me. Help me, Jesus. He's coming down to help him. He's coming down because he hates somebody who would hurt a little child so much. He coming down to put him in hell early. He's coming to put them in hell early and burn them alive with fire and brimstone. \r\n\r\nNumber one: homos are pedophiles because of the cries. Jesus heard the cries of these children. I mean, what other cries are you going to hear? He says, he hears their cries. The cry of the fatherless child and the widow. His ears are open and sensitive to their cries. Their cries is what prompted the call to earth [inaudible 00:34:58] number two: homos are pedophiles because ... \r\n\r\nSpeaker7:\tyoung and old, turn to Genesis 19:4. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tBut before they laid down, the men of the city, even the men of sodom compose[inaudible 00:35:08] the house ground. Both old and young. All the people from every corner and they are calling to Lot and said unto him, where are the men which came into thee this night. Bring them out unto us, that we may know them. \r\n\r\nSpeaker7:\tHow could you be a young person and be so provocative and be so vile. How can you be that despicable and that filth for the earth. How can you be a young person and be that way. I will tell how because they were recruited, they were messed with as a child. They had some sodomites plant a seed in their mind and expose themselves on a restroom to them or whatever, torture and show them graphic materials that they shouldn't be looking at. Show them pictures of things that they shouldn't be looking at and get into their mind and mess with their mind and recruit them because that's what the agenda is. That is what the whole agenda of born that way afterall ministries is. Satan is behind it. He's trying to bing these homos in the churches to play and season kids minds, to mess with kids, to confuse kids and recruit them over to that side and when they get messed with and get recruited. They get better. They get hard hearted. They get tired of God rebuking them and reproving them and they get harder and they stiffen their neck to God and they reject him and Jesus Christ finally gives them over and that's how they become that way. So, we see young and old. \r\n\r\nIt's obvious that they recruit, if they didn't recruit, then why is there young people. Is it a nice work of a young person to want to do. They had to be taught this. They had to be recruited. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tIf we look at stories. There are three stores in the bible that involved sodomy. That involved men who commit acts with other men. They're found in Genesis 9, Genesis 19 and Judges 19. They all involved violating someone against their will. They are all horrible stories of violence. They are all consistent in what they teach. Now the bible has painted a very negative picture of this so called segment of our population because the bible is saying that they're vile. The bible is saying that they are disgusting. The bible is saying that they are reprobate. The bible says they hate God. The bible says that they're filled with murder and malignity and maliciousness and violence and that they're physically rapist and predators and horny people. \r\n\r\nSpeaker7:\tAnd number four, when the homos are pedophile because the bible says, God says, that he that burns for his lust to another man or even the same sex is filled with all unrighteousness. For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections. For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature. And likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the women, burned in their own lust one towards another. Men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge. God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tNow, is pedophilia unrighteousness or not. If pedophilia is unrighteousness and God said you're filled with it. That means you're capable of it. You're capable of anything ad here's the reason why because a reprobate has a conscious sealed with a hard heart. It doesn't bother him. Nothing bothers him. You're filled with all unrighteousness. You're filled with pedophilia. God said it, he said you're filled with all unrighteousness, in the faith reason that I'm going to tell you that the bible teaches us that homos are pedophiles is because God calls them dogs. God calls them dogs. Now if you know anything about a dog, a dog will hawk anything it breeds and not breeds. Pastor Anderson said he recently had a dog and he had to get rid of it because it was just weird. I mean just hawking everything even like the couch and everything else and it was too weird and he got rid of it. Deuteronomy 23:17. There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel. Thou shall not bring the hire of a whore or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow. For even, both these are abomination unto the Lord. Now, it doesn't take a rocky scientist, it doesn't take a theologian to see that Jesus Christ, that God here is using a dog interchangeably with a sodomite. \r\n\r\nJesus says, give not that which is already dogs', neither cast your pearls before swine least they ruin you. The reason why homos are pedophiles is because God said they're dogs. And a dog will hawk anything that breathes. They go any kind of way because they will hawk anything that breathes. I just want to expose a big lie tonight that's out there and this is a lie that the world would teach you. By now, the baptist are repeating the same thing with this, born that way philosophy. Here's what's going on. The bible ... and turn to Leviticus 20:13 because I want to show it to you from Leviticus 20:13 becausse there's a key word that I think that people sometimes overlook in this passage and it's important that we get all the least from the bible not from the world around us. Let's go to Leviticus 20:13 because there's a key word here. Watch this. Third boo in the bible. Everybody turn there. It says, if a man, what's the next word \r\n\r\nJeff Orleans:\tAlso. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tAlso. If a man also. Does it say if a man do this instead. No. It says if a man also. If a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination and they shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. These does not say that a homo only lies with men. This says that he also lies with other men as he lies with women. You see every time you see these stories of the sodomites in the bible, they always go both ways every single time. One of the key stories on these subject is the story in Judges chapter 19 where it describes the sodomites as certain sons of villain bellows to them so these sons of the devil and by the way, once you're a child of God, how long are you a child of God for? \r\n\r\nGuess what, once you're a child of the devil. Guess how long you're a child of the devil for? Forever. That's when you're two folds more of a child of hell, that's when you're twice dead as the bible says. That's when you're given over to a reprobate mind but it says a man also lies with [inaudible 00:42:29] well in Judges chapter 19 is that terrific story where the sodomites surround the house and they want to violate the man inside. They say, bring out that man that came on to you. We want to know him in the biblical sense, like adam knew eve and she conceived and bare him a son. \r\n\r\nSo they say, we want to know him and the man that he's staying with says, don't do such aa vile thing. Notice that word, vile. Don't do so vile a thing and instead what they do is that they take the guy's concubine, his live-in girlfriend. You know the concubine is not a wife, it's basically someone that you lie with that is not your wife so this is what we will call your live-in girlfriend, your bed buddy. They take this guy's concubine and they throw her out of the house and slam the door and say, abuse her instead of abusing him. They toss her out to them and the bible says that the sodomites, they abused here until the morning. So they didn't say like, " gross, we don't like women" you know what I mean " don't you know, we are not attracted to women" you know, "we were born without that desire" no. They just took her as the consolidation prize and they abused her all night. \r\n\r\nYou would say, well that's a disgusting story, it is. But it's the word of God and you know what it's even more disgusting is when you don't know that story and you have to eal with this stuff in real life. See, those of us that are smart will read the disgusting story because God put it in there for a reason and we need to hear it. It's not graphic in the bible. Thank God. It's not graphic but it's showing us reality because it's always better to read the word of God and just trust it and then they have to bring these people in and see what they're like first hand. Which is what the independent baptist are experimenting with right now to their own confusion and to the confusion of their children's nakedness and so what we see here is that in Judges 19 they go both ways. \r\n\r\nWhat about the story of sodom and gomorrah itself. In the story of sodom and gomorrah itself it teaches that all the men of the city and it's very repetitive to tell us that everybody was there. All the men in the city, every single person other than lot is a homo in sodom because they all come surrounding the house and say, bring these men out to us so that we may know them but yet it talks about there being little children in the city because it talks about young and old, great and small. That tells me that they're producing children with women because two dudes can't produce a child. \r\n\r\nAudience:\tRight. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tSo therefore the man of sodom must have clearly gambled ways in order to produce its children. And then if we go back to the story at Genesis chapter 9 where we see Ham. You know, bible didn't give us the detail but he look upon his father's nakedness which is often, you know, uncovering the nakedness is euphemism in the bible, sort of like lie with or to know them, to uncover the nakedness, some perverted act there. \r\n\r\nWell we know Ham had children so he clearly went both ways as well. So every time we see them in the bible, what the world would call them is bi- right. Isn't that what the world will take ... well they're bi but here's the thing, quoting the bible, they're all bi. They all go both ways but why because it's a man who also lies meagan and see they didn't just completely leave the use of the woman, they left the natural use of the women and let me ask this, can you leave the natural use of the woman if you never used the woman. Look, in order to leave somewhere you have to have been there. I can't say I left faithful word baptist church. You ever been there? No. So how can you leave the natural use of a woman if you have never been there. They left the natural use of the woman. \r\n\r\nThey laid also with mankind as they've laid with women but we're suppose to believe this lie that the world tells us, "oh, this sodomites, they're not attracted to women" that's the lie that's out there. They have no desire for women. They never had. They never did according to the world so who should I believe, the bible or the world. It's nothing like that in the bible. But yet this born that way movement says, oh well, these people are born eunuchs and they don't desire either men or women so then they just end up getting confused and accidentally been with bunch of dudes by accident. Whoops. \r\n\r\nNow, look you accidentally make a wrong turn and they are exception. You accidentally put cream on your cereal instead of milk, right. You accidentally slip out of an interview, you did not accidentally be intimate with multitude of other men because you are a little confused. That's a lie at the pit of hell and what it all comes down to this is the fundamental baptist, they want to meet the sodomites half way. Well, okay, you guys aren't born that way but you've got to be celibate though because you're born eunuchs. Stupid. I know. I didn't want to repeat it ... but you know we kind of meet you half way. Like okay, we get it. Yeah, you're not attracted to women. No. Wrong. That's not what the bible teaches. Get your head out of tv and Hollywood and the magazines that are teaching you that stuff. Get in the word of God and read the scripture for yourself. Read Genesis 19. Read Judges 19. Read Leviticus 20:13. Read Romans 1. They left the use of the woman. They did both according to the bible. That's what scripture actually teaches. So this whole thing is just a fraud flooding through. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tAnd then he claims that the standard answer when children ask their parents, what does it mean to be gay, "gay is when a man does not like girls" why would any parent give their child such a stupid ridiculous answer. No. Gay is when a man is into other dudes. It's not when he doesn't like girls. It's again the strong mind of the entire book. It makes them into a victim and all over this born this way website, either all kinds of articles telling us how we need to love the sodomite and how we should never even call them a sodomite. I use the word sodomite. They call them, "gay" and they said that on the article. There's a whole article on there saying it's wrong to call them sodomites. And they said what you'll say, the bible said sodomites. Here's what they say on this born that way ministries, they said, well even though the bible calls them sodomites, we shouldn't because it's offensive and it's not edifying. Then, they say, I know Jesus called people serpents and vipers but it's okay for him to do it but it's not okay for us to do it. \r\n\r\nI thought he left us an example and we should follow in his steps. Right. We're supposed to be better than Jesus because Jesus was mean and a jerk and rude according to them, we need to be better than Jesus. We need to be softer and nicer because he was just too mean. I mean, sure, he called people serpents and vipers, " but he also walked on water, are you going to walk on water" and then they say, "well Jesus never commanded us to walk on water and he never commanded us to preach like that" actually he did, he said, preach the word, rebuke. What did you think "rebuke" is, it's the sternly tell someone that they're they're wrong. The bible says, rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith. Hard preaching in the old testament. Hard preaching in the new testament. It's always been God's style of preaching. Rough preaching, hard preaching is biblical. Just mood preaching is for false prophets, that's what the bible teaches. But this ministry tell all, don't call them sodomites. You know, I mean, look. God forbid you to actually call them fag or queer but they're saying don't even call us sodomites and don't have this hoax against their mentality. Embrace them, bring in- \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tCalling sin by name has more dent to calling sinners names. Many creatures are caught up in the rhetoric of words that once would have been deemed a acceptable but now it's considered hating. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tSo notice he said, it once would have been deemed as acceptable. That's pretty interesting because earlier in the book, he tells a story about going to youth conference and doesn't name the names but it's obvious where he's talking about because he gives the exact quote from Jeff Orleans youth conference sermon. The sermon is called "struck blind" it was preached at youth conference at first baptist church of Hammond, Indiana. He tells the story, ironically, Johnny Nixon was actually there for that sermon. I remember as a teenager attending a youth conference at the first baptist church of Hammond and hear a message preached on being a true christian man. The preacher brought a powerful message. Imagine what he said was spot-on. I remember one particular part of that sermon quite vividly, in it, he used an incredible strong language to condemn gay men. He called them names and made violent threat. He said the real man should banish homosexuals to non existence. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tHe even said that AIDS was a curse sent from God. Of course the preacher was [inaudible 00:52:05] . sermon was called struck blind, I'm the one who uploaded it to youtube years later. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tBefore I knew it, I was so caught up in the moment that I was standing and shouting, " praise the Lord" I could hardly believe that was me it was totally out of character. The Lord sounded so good at the moment. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tClearly this kind of preaching often takes things way too far and much of what he said was rhetoric and not what he actually believed. In fact his creditor, the preacher who preached this message apologized publicly a few years later for the hurtful language and the suggestions of violence in his sermon. \r\n\r\nJeff Orleans:\tThis is Jeff Orleans. If you're responding to a sermon that I preached about gays, I will like to render the following apology. 15 years ago, I preached a sermon that promoted physically hurting gay people. I was young, stupid and immature. I didn't even hold the belief of hurting people when I wrongfully made those comments. I regret those words and I've asked God to forgive me for them over an over again. I'm not a believer in the gay lifestyle but I was profoundly wrong in making any comments about hurting people. If I could retract the words, I certainly would. \r\n\r\nIn America, we need to stop burning flags and start burning fags. It's about time somebody say what needs to be said. It's reprobate, and AIDS is a curse sent from God. It's a curse sent from God because when you can't say that. Well don't you say, I will [inaudible 00:53:28]on. We need to turn the homo weak, for real. [inaudible 00:53:36]Put it on television brother, put it on probation, then put it back on the car[inaudible 00:53:46]. Those of you that are yelling and screaming and shouting. The reason they came out of their closet because there weren't enough men on the other side to tell them to keep them in. If there were men, we won't have that problem. We need to take them all out and kill them with a scouter shot gun. \r\n\r\nJeff Orleans:\tI no longer preach like that. I purposely teach and train others to preach of the hate properly as well. The hurtful words in that sermon tape were erased many years ago and somehow re-surfaced much to my disappointment and embarrassment. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tHowever, this is the key. That was pretty much how we all felt about it at that time. We knew homosexuality was wrong and perverted and not only that it was unnatural. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tI mean, think about this. There were thousands of people at that sermon. Youth conference is a huge event at first baptist church of Hammond. Thousands of people were there and if you listen at the recording of Jeff Orleans preaching that sermon, you can hear the whole place is shouting, amen. If you listen real careful on the tape. You'll even hear Johnny Nixon shouting amen. Okay. What's funny is that he admits that in the mid 90s because that sermon, I think it was preached on '94 or '96, somewhere on it. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tin the mid 90s we all felt that way about it at that time. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tOkay. What's the difference 20 years later? Could it be 20 years of brain washing in Hollywood programming and tv programming and the media cramming these down our throat. So, according to Johnny Nixon, all of us were wrong back then. Everybody who was at that youth conference cheering and carrying ... everyone was on. Why didn't no one have a problem with Jeff Orleans sermon when he preached. Why didn't anyone tell him at that time. Hey, you did not say that ... why didn't he apologize at that time. I uploaded that to youtube and the sodomites persecuted Jeff Orleans. That's when he apologized. The reason he didn't apologize in the 90s is because in the 90s, that was normal preaching and nobody was offended. Nobody battered an eye. Nobody cared. Now, all of a sudden, it's hate speech according to him and back then, he knew homosexuality was wrong and perverted and not only that, it was unnatural. You know what, I'm still in that 90s time frame, that mentality. It's funny how now, these preachers, Jeff Orleans, Bob Ray, Johnny Nixon, they're promoting these garbage and they even call me an idiot and you're crazy. Your preaching is insane. \r\n\r\nBut it's identical to what they preached in the 90s and he said, look we all felt that way about it at the time. So these guys have changed with the times and they expect us to go right down the tube with them. \r\n\r\nJohnny Nixon:\tMy position on homosexuality was pretty standard. It was a sin and an abomination to the Lord. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tWhat these people are doing is turning our country into a modern day sodom and gomorrah. That's what they're doing to our country and they don't care. They don't care, if they care they'll do something to stop it, my friend. If they loved me, they talk so much about love. They only love themselves. \r\n\r\nAudience:\tThat's right. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tBecause if they loved me, if they loved you, if they loved our children, you know what they'll do, they will try to stop our country from turning into a modern day sodom and gomorrah. That's what they will do if they really loved us. They don't love us. Otherwise explain these, why should they explain to me, why the leaders of the fundamental baptist movement are supporting born that way ministries and "don't say sodomites" you offend me with your clear loving doctrine. You offend me with your watered down compromise. They wouldn't touch Romans 1 with a 10 foot pole. They're sacred of it because they love money. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tI finally figured out the real reason why Bob Gray is still so vehemently defending this wicked ministry, born that way ministries. These bunch of perverts and these wicked doctrine, well because he's involved in this independent baptist online college and it turns out that Johnny Nixon, the founder of this faggedy ministry, this born that way ministries is the bible teacher on his independent baptist online college. If you go their website and look at their faculty. It lists about 17, 18 different teachers and under bible instruction, bible teachers, you'd see Johnny Nixon there listed. This whole "independent baptist online college is a scam anyway. It's just basically a money making scam. \r\n\r\nWell I came across a video where vice president of the college, David Baker, who by the way is also buddies with Johnny Nixon and everything Johnny Nixon is doing on Facebook. He's clicking like and all these born that way filth but anyway, this video by David Baker, he's explaining how to start your own chapter of the online bible college for your local church so basically what you do is you get the young people in your church to sign up for online bible college and so they stay at your church. They don't have to go off to college. They can stay in your church because you have like a satellite of the online bible college that you run out of your church. It's all done locally with you there, with your college students and this is just a way for them to get a lot more students for their online bible course. Bob Gray is traveling every week and promoting this everywhere he goes trying to get all the pastors that he preaches for to set up this online chapter. Well you can't believe what a scam this is. You'll hear them explain it even from David Baker's own mouth. \r\n\r\nBut basically, here is what they are telling pastors. You know, you can make money of this as a pastor because what you'll do as a pastor who has an online chapter of this. You video and record yourself teaching a class and then basically your church members will have to pay a 100 dollars to watch that class. Instead of pastors now, just teaching their people the bible. Instead, pastors will just video and record themselves teaching and then charge their people a hundred bucks a person to get that teaching. This is what is so ridiculous about it, is that all that 100 dollars that they pay per class or if it's a two credit class, they pay 200 dollars a class. If it's a three credit class, they pay 300 dollars. It's a 100 dollars per credit. The thing that's so weird about this is that the pastor who creates the video, the pastor who does the teaching, he gets 30% of the money. So he gets 30 bucks and then 70 bucks goes to David Baker and friends. You know, their ministry, independent bible online college. \r\n\r\nSo basically instead of me as a pastor to just, teaching the bible to my church people. I'm suppose to go to an empty room somewhere and just record myself teaching. The example he gives is personal evangelism class or soul winning. So I'm just going to talk into the camera and just explain how to do personal evangelism. How to do soul winning. Instead of just letting my people watch that, uploading that to youtube, handing them a DVD, I'm going to send that to David Baker so that he can send it back to my people for a 100 bucks a person. So basically, I take a video that I already have in my possession that I taught. I send it to him and then he sends it back to my church members so that I can get 30 bucks and he can get 70 bucks for that transaction. Shouldn't we as pastors just be willing to teach our people everything they need to know from the bible for free. Why would I charge money to my own church members, 30 bucks for me to teach them how to go soul winning. Shouldn't I be willing to just give them that teaching for free and why does he get 70 bucks. The whole thing is a scam and a fraud. \r\n\r\nDavid Baker:\tSo a class you teach, we are going to pay you 30% of the tuition that comes in from that. If you teach a two credit course and other people take your class, that's a 1000 dollars that we get to give to you and that class will be taught every semester. Anytime any one takes that class then you will be able to get paid for that. The other thing is this, if you have a class that you really want to teach. That you want your students to get. I used the illustration, a personal evangelism. I taught personal evangelism in the college and so if you wanted your students to have your personal evangelism class then you can record it and your students can get your personal evangelism class. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tI taught that pastors are already getting paychecks from their local church. I'm not against pastors getting paid. I'm of all pastors getting paid but are we suppose to conceal our bible preaching. Conceal our teachings, conceal personal evangelism 101 unless you pay a 100 bucks, 70 bucks of which goes to him and 30 bucks goes to me because if I play my cards right, a 100 people take my class. I can get 6000 and Baker can get 14000. And I'm not saying that it all goes to Baker but it goes to their ministry or whoever his buddies are, you know Bob Gray and Smear and Baker and Johnny Nixon and whoever is into this thing. So anyway I just wanted to just break that down to you just how insane it is to charge money and by the way, if you want to learn how to go soul winning. Why don't go online and watch brother Roger Jimenez's soul winning seminar. It's free. He's not charging his people a 100 bucks a pop to watch it. Where 70 bucks goes to some other guy. \r\n\r\nThe love of money is the root of all evil and I knew that when you see these evil teaching of Johnny Nixon and born that way ministries and this born a eunuch doctrine being promoted. That had to be something. You always have to follow the money and here's where the money trails leads. Johnny Nixon is part of this online baptist college. He's the bible instructor. One of the eighth bible instructor that they list on their website and so that's what's going on. \r\n\r\nDavid Baker:\tWith this pastor, we would like you to be able to record your own classes. Every pastor that's been around for a while has taught the wings in our bible study and when you got done, you say, wow, this is really good. You gave me some great information. I would love to get this out of the people but how, is really not a platform to be able to go somewhere and teach for 6 months, what God gave you and that which is like bible setting. Well, now you do. Pastor, we would like you to record that and for that to be a class that we offer in our college. Your students can take it and our whole college can take it and we will pay you to do that. \r\n\r\nspeaker 6:\tIt's all some money making scam, Bob Gray is the head of it, he's the chancellor of this online bible college and his bible teacher is Johnny Nixon, so if you want to get a bible course degree where your bible instructor comes from a guy that thinks that the eunuchs in the bible are actually homos. That teaches that homos are just eunuchs and won't teach what Romans 1 teaches and if you want your bibl instructor to be a guy who has teemed up with Phil Robinson from duck dynasty who is church of Christ and believes in baptist regeneration and if you want your bible teacher to be from a guy who post pictures of Jesus mortal images on his Facebook timeline as being beautiful well then, you know independent baptist online college is for you and if you believe that homosexuals are born that way afterall, like the title of Johnny Nixon's book, well then, independent baptist online college is where you can go. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tThe bible reads in Romans 1:24, wherefore God also gave them up to cleanliness through the lust of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves. Who changes the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever, amen. For this cause, God gave them up unto vile affections, for even their women did change the nature use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another. Men with men, working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet and even as they did not want to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things that are not convenient. \r\n\r\nAdam Fannin:\tIt was their choice. They heard the truth but they hated it, verse 27 it says, and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another. Men with men, working that which is unseemly. They're burning their lust. They become a reprobate. God gave them over. God gave them ... came upon them and they were burned that way eternally. They were not born that way. They had to choose it, accept it and now they are trying to normalize it. \r\n\r\nSpeaker 1:\tThe bible is really clear on salvation. It's not based on how good you are. A lot of people think that they're pretty good, you know, they're going to get to heaven because they're pretty good but the bible says, for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. The bible says, as it written, there's none righteous, no, not one. I'm not righteous. You're not righteous. And if there were all goodness that will get us into heaven none of us will be going because the bible even says in Revelation Chapter 21:8, it says that the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable and murderers and sorcerers and the whoremongers and idolaters, listen to this, and all liars should have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death. I've lied before. Everybody have lied before. So we have all sinned and we've done stuff worst than lying, let's face it. \r\n\r\nWe all deserve hell but the bible says, the guy committed his love towards us and yet while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. So Jesus Christ, because he loves us came to this earth, the bible says, he was God manifest in the flesh. God basically took on human form he lives a sinless life. He did not commit any sin and of course they beat him and spit on him and nailed him to the cross. The bible says that when he was on that cross. He, himself bear our sins in his own body on the tree. So every sin you've ever done, every sin that I've ever done, it was as if Jesus had done it. He was being punished for our sins and then of course they took his body when he died. They took his body and buried it in a tomb and his soul went down to hell for three days and three nights. Acts 2:31, three days later, he rose again from the dead. He showed unto the disciples, the holes in his hands and the bible was really clear that Jesus did die for everybody. It says that he died not for our sins only but also for the sins of the whole world. \r\n\r\nBut there's something we must do to be saved. The bible says, he asked that question in Acts 16, what must I do to be saved? And they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and thy house. And that's it. He didn't say join a church and you'll be saved. Be baptized and you'll be saved. Live a good life and you'll be saved. Repent of all your sins and you'll be saved. No. He said, believe. And even the most famous verse in the whole bible is written on the body ... I mean the reference is written on the bottom of the [inaudible 01:10:39] I mean it's so famous. Everybody has heard of it, John 3:16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. And everlasting means everlasting, means forever. And Jesus say, I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither should any man pluck them out of my hand. \r\n\r\nThe bible says in John 6:47, verily, verily, I say to you, he that believeth on me have everlasting life. So if you believe on Jesus Christ, the bible says, you have everlasting life. You're going to live forever. You can't lose your salvation. It's eternal. It's everlasting. Once you're saved. Once you believe on him. You're saved forever and no matter what you can never lose your salvation. Even if I were to go out and commit some awful sin, God will punish me for it on this earth. If I went out and killed someone today, God is going to make sure that I get punished. I'm going to prison or far worse, a death penalty. Whatever it is, God punishes me and God is going to make sure I get punished even more but I'm not going to hell. \r\n\r\nThere's nothing I could do to go to hell because I'm saved and if I went to hell. God lied because he promised that whoever believeth in him has everlasting life and he said that whosoever believeth in me shall never die. That's why there's lots of examples of people in the bible who did some really bad stuff, yet they made it to heaven. How? Because they were so good. No. It's because they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. Their sins are forgiven. Other people who may have lived a better life in the world's eye or maybe even really they lived a better life, they don't believe in Christ, they're going to have to go to hell to be punished for their sins. \r\n\r\nLet me just close on these one thought, one thing that I would wanted to be shared and bring up today is that there was a question that was asked to Jesus by one of his disciples and that question was this, are there few that be saved? That's a good question, right. I mean, are most people saved or is it few that are saved. Now, who here thinks that most people are going to heaven. Most people also aren't going to heaven. Guess what the answer was, he said in Matthew 7, for example, he said, enter ye in at the straight gate. He said because wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in there at. Because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. And then he went unto to say these, he said, not every one that saith unto me, Lord , Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. \r\n\r\nAnd so you see, there're people out there. First of all, the majority of this world doesn't believe ever claim to believe in Jesus. Thankfully the majority of this classroom claims to believe in Jesus, okay. But the majority of the world does not claim to believe in Jesus but God warned that even amongst those who claim to believe in Jesus, even amongst those that call him Lord, many will be saying to him, " Oh Lord, we did all these wonderful works, why aren't we saved" Jesus said depart from me that because salvation is not by works. And if you're trusting your own works to save you. \r\n\r\nIf you think you're going to heaven because you've been baptized or if you think you ... well I think you have to live a good life. I think you have to keep the commandments to be saved. I think you have to go to church. I think you got to turn from your sins. Now if you're trusting in your works, Jesus is going to say to you one day depart from me, I never knew you. You have to have all our faith on what he did. You have to put your faith on what Jesus did on the cross when he died for you, is buried and rose again. That's your take-in into heaven. If you trust on all the thing ... "Oh, I'm going to heaven because I'm such a good christian and I do all these wonderful thing" Jesus says, depart from me. And notice what he said, depart from me, I never knew you. Not, I used to know you because once he knows you, remember I mentioned this earlier. It's everlasting. It's eternal. Once he knows you, you are saved forever but he's going to say, depart from me, I never knew you because he never knew you because once he knows you, he knows you. \r\n\r\nIt's just like my children will always be my children. You know, when you're born again. When you're his child. You'll always be his child. You may be the black sheep of the family. You may be somebody who gets disciplined by God heavily on this earth. You can screw up your life down here but you can't screw that up. You know, you're saved. It's a done deal. That's the main thing that I wanted to present to you about the end times. We do have just a few minutes for questions about either salvation or about the end times.	Documentary	2017-04-17 22:45:29.465799	2017-04-23 14:15:59.199542	burn-that-way-after-all-documentary	0

Theoretical physicists such as Lawrence Krauss, Michio Kaku, Stephen Hawking and others produce bizarre fictional theories about the origin and nature of our universe that have no basis in observable reality. If people really knew what these so called scientists believe, they would understand the truth of what the Bible says in Romans 1:22. "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: It takes no energy to create a universe. Universes are for free. A universe is a free lunch. Then you may say to yourself, "Well, that can't be right."\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: Essentially you can get a universe from nothing without any supernatural shenanigans that basically, by quantum mechanics and the laws of psychics we understand in principle, an entire universe with 100 billion galaxies, each containing 100 billion stars, can come from nothing because its total energy could be zero and therefore you don't need to literally violate any laws of physics to create a universe. Now, we don't know that for certain.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: In other words, the universe is for free.\r\n\r\nStephen Hawking: Because there are laws such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: In fact if you ask what would be the characteristics of a universe that was created from nothing just by the normal laws of physics, it would be precisely the characteristics of the universe we live in. Again, that doesn't prove it, but it makes it quite plausible.\r\n\r\nStephen Hawking: Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing. It is why the universe exists, why we exist.\r\n\r\nRT Anchor: Then how did we go from nothing to something?\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: Because in fact if you add up all the energy in the universe, it looks like it's zero. Everything we see was once contained in a region smaller than the size of an atom. It's hard to imagine, but it's true. In fact I wrote a whole book about it.\r\n\r\nNews Anchor: And we talked about it on this program, I believe.\r\n\r\nJohn Green: In the barest fraction of the first second the universe inflated from something many, many, many times smaller than an atom to about the size of a grapefruit. Think of it this way, in much less than a blink of an eye, if it had originally been the size of a tennis ball, it would have inflated over 90 billion light-years across.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: We believe, though we cannot yet prove, that our multiverse of universes is 11-dimensional. Think of this 11-dimensional arena and in this arena there are bubbles, bubbles that float, and the skin of the bubble represents an entire universe. We're like flies trapped on fly paper. We're on the skin of a bubble, it's a 3-dimensional bubble. The 3-dimensional bubble is expanding and that's called the Big Bang theory.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: Our universe is just a small random accident in a vast multiverse and it's fascinating because it means, as each universe pops out or falls out of inflation, it can fall out in a different way. It's like falling down a mountain. You can fall in lots of different directions and each different direction that you leave inflation, in some sense, could give different laws of physics in that region of space or at least certain different laws of physics. If that's the case it may be that many of the fundamental laws that we see and think are truly fundamental are just accidents of our experience. It could be in each universe there are different laws of physics and that may help explain other paradoxes about the universe we see.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: We're nothing but a soap bubble floating in a bubble bath of soap bubbles. In some sense, the multiverse can be liken to a bubble bath. Our universe is nothing but one bubble, but there're other bubbles. When two bubbles collide, that could merge into a bigger bubble, which could be the Big Bang. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity like a pile of pasta, water boiling over. In fact, that's what probably the Big Bang is, or perhaps a bubble visioned in half and split off into two bubbles. That could be the Big Bang.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: Some people get upset that we change the meaning of nothing.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: Or perhaps the universe popped into existence out of nothing. That is also a possibility.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: Most of the religious people object to my definition of nothing never defined it themselves. Here's what their definition of nothing is. Nothing is that from which only God can create something. Come on. They create this useless definition.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: The universe could essentially be nothingness, which was unstable, and created a soap bubble. Now you may say to yourself, "That can't be right because then it violates the conservation of matter and energy. How can you create a universe from nothing?"\r\n\r\nYoutuber: Spacetime was created by the Big Bang. Thus, time didn't exist before the Big Bang, so it doesn't make much sense to ask what happened before it. There was no 'then' then. Of course, this like many ideas in cosmology doesn't really make any sense to our puny human brains. It's largely beyond our comprehension.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: Otherwise very speculative ideas because inflation, even though it was well motivation, is based on physics we've never measure, physics that what we call the grand unified scale, and without an empirical handle, it's all just talk.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: The highest dimension is 11. You cannot go beyond 11 because universes become unstable beyond 11.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: We have now in some sense hit the holy grail. Just a few months ago the announcement was made of observations that really turned metaphysics into physics, that take us back literally to a millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, which is a time frame I've never thought we'd be able to observe directly. If they hold up, and I should say that it's just a single observation right now and in science we have to be quite skeptical, and has to be confirmed before we can really rely on it, but will allow us to test theories about the beginning of our universe and potentially the existence of other universes.\r\n\r\nFemale Physicist: For every physicist that's the kind of holy grail.\r\n\r\nTV Host: These waves interact so weakly that they've really been propagating to us from a millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of the second after the Big Bang and that means that we've changed everything.\r\n\r\nTV Host: 13 billion years later we have a way to see this cosmic glow with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nDr. David Spergel: You take your TV set, switch it between channels. A couple of percent of the static that you see on your TV screen is radiation from the Big Bang.\r\n\r\nTV Host: This cosmic radiation is a direct connection to the Big Bang. It also reveals the universe entered a new phase less than a trillionth of a second after its creation.\r\n\r\nFemale Physicist: If you could go back to the really early universe just after the Big Bang, you'd find yourself in this seething, massive matter and anti-matter annihilating each other. You'd find yourself in the middle of this cosmic battle between both sides, caught in the crossfire, if you like.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: In some sense it explains why we're here, because it turns out, and it's amazing accident, and these were ideas that were known about 40 years ago and we hadn't yet been able to test them, that the only reason the particles in our body have mass that can form together to form us and everything we see on earth is it's an accident.\r\n\r\nJohn Green: Because it turns out, if you take a bunch of hydrogen and you wait like several billion years, you might just grow yourself some humans.\r\n\r\nBen Stein: Well, then how did it get created?\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: Well, by a very slow process.\r\n\r\nBen Stein: How did it start?\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: Nobody knows how it started. We know the kind of event that it must have been. We know the sort of event that must have happened for the origin of life.\r\n\r\nBen Stein: What was that?\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: It was the origin of the first self-replicating molecule.\r\n\r\nBen Stein: Right, and how did that happen?\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: I've told you we don't know.\r\n\r\nBen Stein: You have no idea how it started?\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: No, no. Nor has anybody.\r\n\r\nBen Stein: Nor has anyone else.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: This belief system that today is known as science, the falsely so called science that God predicted would come about, this science falsely so called is not based on facts, it's not based on knowledge. It's actually a belief system. It's more like a religion. This is why a lot of people today will ask you this question, "Well, do you believe in science?" See, if it were just fact, if it were just knowledge, if it were something that could actually be proven through observation, experimentation, then you wouldn't have to believe in it. The reason you have to believe is because it's a religion, because of the fact that it is not science. It is a belief system and that belief system is based on two things I'm going to demonstrate this morning.\r\n\r\nNumber one, that belief system is based upon hatred for God, and by that I mean the God of the Bible, and number two, it's based upon science fiction, and I'm talking about Buck Rogers this morning. I'm talking about Star Trek. I'm talking about Star Wars. I'm talking about all the sci-fi that the Hollywood movies and the TV shows have made popular. That is really the basis for this belief system, and they say, "Oh, we're so rational. We're so logical." No, you're not. "Oh, it's all based on facts. It's all based on experiments." No, it isn't. It's based on two things. Number one, a deep-seated hatred for the God of the Bible and number two, it's based upon watching too many science fiction movies and TV shows. Those are the basis and I'm going to prove that to you. Now, Romans chapter 1, verse 19, the Bible says, "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them."\r\n\r\nNow, manifest means that it's able to be seen. It's out there. "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse." You see, if they actually would perform observations and experimentation of the natural world that we live in, it would just proclaim the glory of the creator who made all of it. That is the logical conclusion, but it says in verse 21, "Because, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools." Jump down to verse 28. "And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient."\r\n\r\nNow, what I want to point out here is that these people who deny the God of the Bible, these people, the Bible says don't want to retain God in their knowledge, why don't they want to retain God in their knowledge? Well, that's explained in verse 29 and on. "Being filled with all unrighteousness." Yet you don't want to retain God in your knowledge when you're filled with all unrighteousness because God is so holy, it's a constant reminder of your own unrighteousness. Not only that, it says in verse 30 about these same people, "Back biters, haters of God." That's what I'm saying about this belief system. These people hate God. They don't want to retain God in their knowledge, so therefore they set out to teach and preach the gospel of atheism.\r\n\r\nThey go out to evangelize people that there is no God and they do it in the name of science, but it's science falsely so called. It's not real science. It's their belief. It's their faith. It's their system or ideology. Here are some of the big name preachers of this science religion. Richard Dawkins, Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Christopher Hitchens, Bill Nye, the Science Guy. These are the apostles of this false religion. These are the false teachers and false prophets. The first preacher of this sci-fi religion that I'd like to go over is Richard Dawkins. This man is an evolutionary biologist and he's the author of a book called The God Delusion. He's probably the most famous atheist, at least from what I've heard. It seems like I've heard of him more than anyone else as being the big, what I call an evangelical atheist, okay?\r\n\r\nSomebody who's just no an atheist, but they want to just preach the gospel of atheism to the whole world. What's funny about that is, if I only had one life to live and I were an atheist and I thought I were just going to die and turn to dust, I wouldn't spend my life trying to fight against an imaginary being called God that supposedly doesn't exist. We've got Don Quixote, Richard Dawkins here, fighting with windmills and shadow-boxing against someone that he doesn't even believe exist. What's his point? Why doesn't he eat, drink and be merry because tomorrow he dies? What's the point, Richard Dawkins? He's a zealous evangelical atheist. Now let's see if his beliefs come from observation and experimentation science or whether they come from where I said they come from, a deep-seated hatred for God. Here's what Richard Dawkins says about God in his book.\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: “The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.”\r\n\r\nBen Stein: That's what you think of God?\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Tell us how you really feel, Richard Dawkins. You can tell here that he hates god.\r\n\r\nAudience: Yeah.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: He hates God. In all of fiction and he's read a lot of fiction. I mean, the God of the Bible is worse than Darth Vader. The God of the Bible is worse than the emperor. The God of the Bible is worse than all of the villains of science fiction. He's such a bully. Here's what's funny, is that there was a debate between him and another guy and the guy asked him, "How do you know that the God of the Bible is not real?" He said, "Well, the reason why is because the God of the Bible is this misogynistic, homophobic" yada yada yada. Does that make logical sense ...\r\n\r\nAudience: No.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: ... to say that something doesn't exist because it's unpleasant? "Well, because God is the most unpleasant villain ever, that means he doesn't exist." Let me ask you something Richard Dawkins. Do you think I'm pleasant? Because I exist and I happen to be homophobic. I'm constantly labeled as misogynistic. I'm constantly labeled as being this horrible person by the world, but you know what? I exist. I'm here. As Jesus said, "Handle me and see that I am flesh and bone, and a spirit has not flesh and bone as you see me to have." What kind of science is that, to say, "It doesn't exist because I don't like its personality." That's real logical. That makes a lot of sense, buddy. "That's how we know." Then he's asked, "Is it possible that intelligent design is there from some other being?" He said, "It is possible that aliens could have created us."\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: It could kind of bout in the following way. It could be that at some earlier time, somewhere in the universe a civilization evolved by probably some kind of Darwinian means to a very, very high level of technology and designed a form of life that they seeded on to perhaps this planet. That is a possibility and an intriguing possibility and I suppose it's possible that you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of our chemistry, molecular biology you might find a signature of some sort of designer.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: It's possible that "long ago, in a galaxy far, far away" someone planted life on earth and put life here, but not the God of the Bible. Does that sound scientific or does it sound pretty biased, based on his deep-seated hatred for God?\r\n\r\nAudience: Right.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: There's another reason why these guys come up with this stuff that's not based on evidence, that's not based upon experimentation, but it's just based on their belief system. Go to 2 Peter, chapter number 3. "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts." Here's where it all comes from, "Walking after their own lusts." That's where it all starts. He says, "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts and saying, 'Where is the promise of his coming?' for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." Look, when it says creation there, I've heard somebody say, "These are Christians because they believe in creation." No.\r\n\r\nChristians are not the only ones who believe in creation. The atheists believe in creation. It's just a different creation. Their creation story is the Big Bang. We'll get to that a little later. It says here, "All things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of." It's not that they went into the lab, did some experiments and said, "You know, the conclusion I've drawn is that there's no God." No, no, no. They're willingly ignorant. What is it that makes them have a will to be ignorant about the creation? They have a will to be ignorant about the flood. It says they are, "Willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old."\r\n\r\nThat God spake the world into existence, that God said, "Let there be light" and there was light. That in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. It says, "And the earth standing out of the water and in the water." The two things they're ignorant of there are the creation and the flood, which account for the physical phenomenon that we see in this world, the creation and the flood. They're ignorant of those things. They make up their own version, but why are they willingly ignorant? The Bible says it is because they are walking after their own lusts. Now more evidence of this is found in Psalm 14. You don't have to turn there. In Psalm 14:1 the Bible reads, "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"\r\n\r\nOften we stop quoting there. We don't quote the whole verse. You've heard that statement your whole life. Let's read the whole verse. "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good." That's the whole verse. What's the verse actually saying here? He said that there's no God because he's corrupt and because he has done abominable works, so he doesn't want to believe that there's a God. The same thing is found in Psalm 53, verse 1. "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good." That's the reason, according to 2 Peter, 3, according to Psalm 14, according to Psalm 53.\r\n\r\nListen to this. You say, "What makes you think that Richard Dawkins has done abominable iniquity? First of all, we already know that he hates God. I don't think anybody would doubt that. I don't think anybody would argue with that. Listen to this story. This is from The Huffington Post. Now, who here thinks that The Huffington Post is a radical, conservative news outlet? No, this is godless, God-hating outlet, and even they're calling out Richard Dawkins' wickedness. "Richard Dawkins pedophilia remarks provoke outrage." That's the headline.\r\n\r\nDavid Pakman: Richard Dawkins has made some statements that some are considering to be a little bit odd. He essentially defended mild pedophilia. Richard Dawkins kind of set the stage as the evolutionary biologist who is known for being what some consider an outspoken atheist. He told the story to The Times magazine of England that he was sexually abused when he was a kid. He says that a teacher put his hands in his shorts and that it didn't do lasting harm. Then he said, the exact quote was, "An unidentified school master pulled me on his knee and put his hand inside my shorts" when he was a child. He said that he didn't think that the abuse, which he referred to as "mild touching up" did any of us any lasting harm. I guess it wasn't just to him that this was one, it was to some of his classmates as well.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Said that he was unable to condemn what he called "mild pedophilia" that he experienced at an English school when he was a child in the 1950s. Where do this guy's beliefs coming from? He's molested as a kid and he says, "I can't condemn it. I can't condemn the fact that my teacher that was a dude molested me. No big deal. It's just mild pedophilia." What a bunch of filth. This is the most renowned atheist out there. This is the kind of stuff he's saying. He said other children in this school peer group had been molested by the same teacher, but he concluded, "I don't think he did any of us lasting harm." I've noticed something about you that you hate God. I wonder if that has to do with the fact that you were molested.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. It didn't harm me all." No, it turned you into a God-hating atheist. You'll often find that people, when they get molested, they lash out against God and hate God and become a hater of God unfortunately. Not everyone. Of course, there's redemption there and a lot of people who've been molested were able to get over that and live normal lives and live godly lives, but unfortunately there's a tendency for those who get molested to be bitter against God. They shouldn't but that's just a phenomenon. He said the most notorious cases of pedophilia involve rape and even murder and he shouldn't be bracketed in with what he called just a mild whatever.\r\n\r\nUnless they kill you, I mean, unless they just violently abuse, come on, it's just a little mild pedophilia. Look, anyone who says that I believe is a pedophile themselves because no normal person would justify pedophilia like, "It's no big deal." I submit to you that Richard Dawkins is presumably a pedophile if he's going to say that it's fine. Why else would he be saying it's fine? Let's see what Richard Dawkins considers child abuse. Here's a quote from his book The God Delusion. "Faith can be very, very dangerous, and deliberately to implant it into the vulnerable mind of an innocent child is a grievous wrong." He says that putting faith into the mind of an innocent child, that is a grievous wrong, but just molesting and raping it mildly, "I can't condemn it. But don't you dare teach him the Bible."\r\n\r\nYou're going to tell me that this man is so smart and oh, he's so intelligent, and oh, oh, oh, how dare you, pastor Anderson, speak against Richard Dawkins when he has more intelligence in his little finger than you have in your whole body? You're just an uneducated pumpkin because my apostle of my sci-fi religion is so much smarter than you. No, he thinks pedophilia is fine and that teaching the Bible is child abuse. You can't even make this stuff up. The truth is stranger than fiction. This stuff's bizarre, isn't it?\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins: If you think about it, teaching kids or allowing the notion that the earth is 6000 years old to be promulgated in school, that's child abuse.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Let's about the creation myth of this sci-fi religion. Number one we talked about the preachers. There are these preachers. We talked about one, Richard Dawkins. We're going to get into some more. Let's talk about their creation myth. What does the Bible teach about creation? Go to Genesis, chapter 1 if you would. "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." I'm going to also read for you Exodus 20, verse 11. "For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is, but he rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." We see there than in six days God made the heaven and the earth. That's Genesis 1:1.\r\n\r\n"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" and "the sea and all that in them is" so there's no gap between Genesis 1, verse 1 and verse 2. For sake of time we'll just jump down to verse 24. "And God said, 'Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth after their kind'; and it was so." Something that comes up with the plants and with the animals is that they reproduce after their own kind. This is not evolution. When it says kind it doesn't mean necessarily the exact species or the exact variation. For example, the kind of animal doesn't change, but you can have wide variety within that kind. For example, you have a dog. That's a kind of animal, a dog. Right?\r\n\r\nBut you have all kinds of different dogs and they all look different. They all share a common ancestor. It's not like God just told Noah to put every breed that the American Kennel Club has listed on the ark. Obviously he's just got two dogs, a male and a female. People said, "You think that all of the dog breeds we see today came from two dogs?" They think that all the animals we see today came from two animals. Hello? They think it's crazy that we think a poodle is related to a rottweiler or whatever or a chihuahua is related to a great dane, but they don't think it's weird to think that an elephant is related to a turtle. That's when they try to make these calculations like, "There's no way you could fit the animals on the ark" because they try to put every little variation of animal on the ark, every species, instead of every kind.\r\n\r\nYou say, "What separates a kind?" If they can breed with each other, it's the same kind. Okay? Obviously you can breed different kinds of dogs and they can breed together and so forth. Everything brings forth after its own kind. What's the creation myth of the sci-fi religion? Now we're going to get into another, one of the prophets of the sci-fi religion named Stephen Hawking.\r\n\r\nStephen Hawking: Because there are laws such as gravity the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing. It is why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: You may ask yourself the question, "How can the universe create itself?" Because gravity. Hello, idiot. How dare you? Wait a minute. Do you even have a degree? Do you have a degree in science, and I'm not talking about mimetics? I'm talking about real science. Do you have a degree in evolutionary biology? Do you have a degree in astrophysics? Do you have a degree in any kind of science? Huh? Because you can't even hold a candle to these great men who preach this sci-fi religion. Listen to me, I don't care if you understand or not, the universe can and will create itself from nothing because gravity. Because gravity, case closed. If you don't get it, well, you're just too dumb to get it and I don't know what to tell you.\r\n\r\n"Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing." Doesn't this really bring new meaning to the verse, "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools"? How can you dare insult the intelligence of Stephen Hawking? If some guy told you that in the street you'd say, "Go home, you're drunk" but because it's Stephen Hawking we take it real seriously and it's repeated in the news. This quote was all over the news as being profound. It's amazing. "Have you read Stephen Hawking's new book? It's fascinating. It's like a bestseller book."\r\n\r\nTV Anchor: Did the universe need a creator? Not according to the physicist and mathematician Stephen Hawking, who argues that God wasn't necessary for the creation of the world. Professor Hawking claims that the Big Bang theory of creation can now be explained by science alone without the need to consider some form of divine intervention.\r\n\r\nStephen Hawking: Because there are laws such as gravity the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.\r\n\r\nTV Anchor: According to Stephen Hawking the latest theory is that our universe is just one of many and the laws of physics must mean that countless other universes were formed before the Big Bang. Would God have done all that just to create us? While the traditional religious view is that it took divine intervention at the very least to start it all, scientists accept that the Hawking theory is controversial.\r\n\r\nTV Anchor: Many theoretical physicists would argue that we are now addressing questions that not so long ago were seen to be beyond the realm of science and what we are doing, inevitably, is pushing religion on to the back foot so that questions where only religion could give hope to give us an answer, science is now doing that as well.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: In the late 1970s Hawking was elected the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. Hawking's promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to Hawking accepting, all be it reluctantly, some nursing services at home. At the same time he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. Okay, so these guys are all about proof. It's all about the evidence, right? No, it's more just like intuitive, man. Dude, dude, just smoke this. You're going to understand black holes, man, I'm telling you. Dude, this is going to take you into a whole new dimension, man. You're not going to need to rely so much on this mathematical proofs. That's stuff is just holding you back, man. You got to get more intuitive. You got to get more speculative, man. Just take this drug, man. It's going to open your mind to a whole new galaxy, man. It's more speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. Who needs them? Who needs proof?\r\n\r\nTV Anchor: While Stephen Hawking himself admits that the theory that there're multiple universes is still just a theory, it's yet to be confirmed by any evidence, which may leave many believing that science hasn't got all the answers yet.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Hey, this is what he said. I'd rather be right than rigorous. I'm not going to be rigorous in my testing and make sure that this stuff is actually right. I'd rather just say I'm right.\r\n\r\nLawrence Krauss: When you're a theoretical physicist and you speculate about what might be, there's nothing more terrifying or perhaps less plausible than the possibility that the universe might actually obey what you're saying. In my career most of the time the universe isn't smart enough to do what I say it should. It's really remarkable when these very speculative ideas that seem well motivated, but almost seem too good to be true actually work out.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Hawking has argued that computer viruses should be considered a new form of life. Is this guy's smart or what? Hawking has argued that computer viruses should be considered a new form of life and has stated, "That maybe it says something about human nature that the only form of life we've created so far is purely destructive. Talk about creating life in our own imagine." You haven't created life, Stephen Hawking. You're never will.\r\n\r\nAudience: Amen.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Only God can create life. In an interview published in the Guardian Hawking regarded the concept of heaven as a myth believing that there is no heaven or afterlife and that such a notion was a fairy story for people who are afraid of the dark. Hawking has stated that given the vastness of the universe aliens likely exist, but that contact with them should be avoided. Here's the thing about that, is that there's no evidence for aliens. None, zero, zilch, nada, but yet when you listen to these atheists, scientists, they all talk about aliens. Why? Because it's based on two things, deep-seated hatred for the God of the Bible, but don't forget element number two, science fiction. Here's a major source.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: I love to watch science fiction movies but I cringe. I cringe whenever I see a depiction of the aliens. First of all, the aliens speak perfect English. Not just British English, they speak perfect American English, and obviously they're a human inside some kind of monkey suit.\r\n\r\nWhen we physicists look for alien civilizations, we don't look for little green men.\r\n\r\nWhen we physicists look at outer space for alien life, we don't look for little green men. We look for type one, type two and type three civilizations. A type one civilization has harnessed the planetary power. They control earthquakes, the weather, volcanoes. They have cities on the ocean. Anything planetary, they control. That's type one. A planetary civilization. A civilization that resembles something out of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon. A type two civilization is stellar. They consume so much energy they can play with stars. That's, for example, the Federation of Planets in Star Trek. Star Trek would represent a typical type two civilization. They play with stars. They are immortal. Nothing known to science can destroy a type two civilization. Then we have type three, which is galactic. The Empire of Star Wars would correspond to a type three civilization. What are we on this scale? On this scale are we type one that control hurricanes, are we type two that control star systems, are we type three that roam the galactic space lanes? No. We're type zero.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Let's jump to the fourth point, the eschatology of the sci-fi religion, the eschatology or end times beliefs of this sci-fi religion. When we think of our eschatology it has to do with the second coming of Jesus Christ. Again eschatology is just a fancy-schmancy word for the study of end times or the study of the last things. Well, our eschatology focuses upon what? The second coming of Jesus Christ. The Book of Revelation that gives end times prophecy, it starts out talking about the second coming of Christ. It says, "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so. Amen." Then it ends with, "Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book."\r\n\r\nIt starts out and ends with, that's the theme, the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. There's an eschatology of the sci-fi religion that has to do with the coming of aliens. We look to the coming of Christ. They look for the coming of aliens. You talk about these guys, they say, "Inevitably, eventually, we're going to come into contact with aliens." Kind of like, "We're waiting for Jesus to come back." They're waiting for aliens. They're waiting for the UFOs to show up. A lot of them are kind of scared of these UFOs too and saying, "It's going to be like when Columbus came to the Indians." It didn't go so well for the Indians. That's how it's going to be when the aliens come to us.\r\n\r\nPart of their eschatology in this sci-fi religion is that they desire a one world government and a one world right now. I'm just going to briefly touch upon one of the apostles of the sci-fi religion named Michio Kaku. This guy, Michio Kaku, is a very famous astrophysicist and he says that if you're not for a one world government, if you're against one world government you're a terrorist. Anyone who doesn't want a one world government, he basically says, "You're a terrorist because you have to understand that it's our destiny."\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: The transition between type zero and type one and that's where we are today. This transition is perhaps the most important transition of all time. Some people don't want it. They fear this transition because this transition is to a planetary civilization tolerant of many cultures. These are the terrorists, that in their gut they fear this because they know they are witnessing the birth pangs of a beginning of a new planetary civilization and the terrorists want nothing to do with it. What is terrorist? Terrorism in some sense is a reaction against the creation of a type one civilization. They don't like the march towards a type one civilization. Which tendency will win? I don't know, but I hope that we emerge as a type one civilization.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Here's the problem, no one's ever discovered a type one civilization. There's no such thing as a type one, type two or type three. Even he'll admit there's no evidence that there's any aliens even out there.\r\n\r\nMichio Kaku: When we look at outer space we see no evidence of type one, two or three anywhere, no evidence whatsoever. The mathematics say that there should be thousands of type one, two and three civilizations on the galaxy. We see no evidence of any whatsoever.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: Yet he has this whole [inaudible 00:40:33]. It'd be sort of like this. It'd be sort of like if I said, "Basketball players can be put in three categories, type one, type two and type three. A type one basketball player can dunk the ball on a 15 foot rim. A type two basketball player can dunk the ball on a 20 foot rim. A type three basketball player can dunk the ball on a 25 foot rim. You know what Michael Jordan is? Type zero. You know what Shaquille O'Neal is, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? You know what these guys are? They're type zero." Wouldn't that be ridiculous and stupid since there's no one who could do those things? It doesn't exist. This is thing that you can expect to hear from someone like Michio Kaku and his inflated ego of his overstated intelligence that, "We're looking for type one, type two and type three civilizations." Come on, haven't you seen Buck Rogers? Haven't you seen Star Trek? Haven't you seen Star Wars?\r\n\r\nHe said, "The only way we're going to make it from a type zero to a type one is a one world government. That's the only way. We must unite in a one world system and the people who don't want to unite are terrorists." Look at Psalm 2, verse 1. "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take council together" and that's what we see now, the rulers uniting together, the United Nations, and they take council together against the Lord and against his anointed or his Christ. Saying, "Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh." You say, "Why do you laugh at these guys this morning? Why do you mock them? Why do you mock a guy in wheelchair?" Come on, you wouldn't mock a guy in glasses, would you? Let me tell you something, the reason I mock, the Lord is going to mock.\r\n\r\nAudience: Amen.\r\n\r\nPastor Anderson: He said, "I'll mock when your fear cometh." "The Lord shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure." We know it's the anti-Christ who wants a one world government, that wants a New World Order. This sci-fi religion is in direct opposition with God's plan for this world. They want that which the devil wants. That's what it all comes down to. These apostles of sci-fi religion, I'll tell you why they're being propped up by the media. Because the media is run by people who want a one world system. A conspiracy to create a New World Order is what is behind propping up these really smart guys that aren't really quite as smart as we thought, are they? It's about a New World Order. It's about the devil.\r\n\r\nLet's bow our heads and have a word of prayer. Father, we thank you so much for the clear teaching of your word, Lord. I thank you so much for the Baptist preachers that I grew up listening to and the Baptist preachers that I would look at today and look up to and listen to their words, and that I don't have to listen to these kind of foolish apostles of sci-fi. Lord, thank you that we have the word of God, which is never changing, always true and beats any science textbook any day of the week.

14	 Marsjeer na Sion ("Marching to Zion" in Afrikaans)	ewYcLhqCl1s	Meer dan 4,000 jaar gelede het God vir Abraham in Mesopotamië verskyn en vir hom gesê: “Gaan jy uit jou land en uit jou familie en uit jou vader se huis, na die land wat Ek jou sal wys. En Ek sal jou 'n groot nasie maak.”Abraham het God gehoorsaam en het na die belowe land van Kanaan getrek, waar hy saam met sy seun Isak en sy kleinseun Jakob, wie later “Israël” hernoem is, gewoon het. \r\n\r\nIsraël en sy 12 seuns het na Egipte gegaan omdat daar honger was in die land van Kanaan, en hulle het baie vermenigvuldig tot hulle ‘n groot nasie geword het. Die Egiptenare het bedreig gevoel deur die kragtige nasie van Israël, dus hulle het vir die Israëliete slawe gemaak en hulle lewes bitter gemaak met harde werk. Na 430 jaar in Egipte is hulle deur Moses uit hulle slawerny gelei; toe het hulle die Skelfsee oorgesteek en was toe in Arabië, waar hulle by die berg Sinaï die wet van God ontvang het. \r\n\r\nVir die generasie Israëliete, wat saam met Moses Egipte verlaat het, was dit verbied om in die belowe land binnen te tree vanweë hulle gebrek aan geloof in die Here. Hulle was gedwing om vir 40 jaar in die wildernis rond te dwaal totdat daar ‘n nuwe generasie ontstaan het wat wèl in die Here vertrou het; en hulle het die belowe land saam met Joshua binnen getree. \r\n\r\nVir ongeveer 400 jaar het die Rigters oor die 12 stamme van Israël geheers, alles volgens die wet van Moses. Toe die mense na ‘n koning verlang het, net soos al die ander nasies, het God vir Saul hulle koning gemaak, en hy het 40 jaar lank oor hulle geheers. Daarna was Dawid vir 40 jaar die koning, toe sy seun Salomo wat ook vir 40 jaar lank die koning was. Tydens die koningskap van Salomo was die koninkryk van Israël op sy mees glorieus en die eerste Tempel is toe gebou. Maar omdat Salomo se hart in sy laaste jare nie meer met God was nie, het God vir hom gesê dat 10 van die stamme nie onder sy seun se koningskap sou val nie. \r\n\r\nNa die dood van Salomo is die koninkryk van Israël in twee geskei, en die 10 noordelike stamme was deur ‘n reeks boosaardige konings gelei wat níe van Dawid en Salomo afgestam het nie. Die Noordelike Koninkryk het die naam Israël behou en uiteintlik was Samaria sy hoofstad. Die kleinere Suider Koninkryk is uiteintlik Juda genoem, met Jerusalem as hoofstad, en die nakomelinge van Dawid het daaroor regeer. Vanaf 2 Konings 16 word die inwoners van die Suider Koninkryk Jode genoem, na die koninkryk Juda. \r\n\r\nVanweë die boosheid van die Noordelike Koninkryk van Israël is die inwoners deur die Assiriërs verower en gevange geneem. Die Israëliete wat agter gebly het is met die heidense nasies gemeng, wat hulle land is binnen getree en die land verower het. Hierde mense sou later die Samaritane genoem word, en die 10 stamme van Noordelik Israël sou nooit weer ‘n nasie word nie. \r\n\r\nDie Suider Koninkryk van Juda sou uiteintlik deur Babylonië verower word as ‘n straf omdat hulle ander gode gedien het, en die Tempel sou vernietig word; maar na 70 jaar het die Jode terug na Juda gekeer. Hulle het die Tempel in Jerusalem herbou en is weer deur nakomelinge van Dawid gelei. \r\n\r\nIn die tyd van Christus was die nasie van Juda nou Judea genoem en was onder Romeinse beheer. Jesus Christus en Sy dissipels het die Evangelie deur die hele land gepreek om die verlore skape van die huis van Israël te vind. Na 3 ½ jaar preek het die Jode vir Jesus as hulle Messias verwerp; toe het hulle die Romeinse goeverneur oortuig om Hom te kruisig. Drie dae later het Hy uit die dood herrys en Syself lewend vir Sy dissipels getoon, voordat Hy die Hemelvaart gemaak het om aan die regterkant van die Vader in die Hemel te wees. \r\n\r\nKort voordat Jesus gekruisig was, het Hy voorspel dat Jerusalem verbrand sou wees, en dat die Jode oor alle lande versprei sou word; dit was die straf omdat hulle vir Hom afgewys het. Hierdie voorspelling is in 70NC waar gemaak toe die Romeinse keiser Titus Jerusalem verower het. Vir meer dan 1800 jaar het die Jode versprei gebly ooral in die wêreld. \r\n\r\nEn tóe in 1948 het die onmoontlike gebeur. Die Staat van Israël is gestig en die Jode was weereens in die belowe land. Baie Christene het dit as ‘n wonderwerk verklaar, en ‘n seën van God. Maar was dit rêrig ‘n seën van God, of was daar sprake van ‘n donkere mag wat besig was? Hierdie film het die antwoord!	2017-04-07	2017-04-24 19:06:44.652237	2017-04-24 19:06:44.652237	3	marsjeer-na-sion-marching-to-zion-in-afrikaans
15	Die Bybel se Weg na die Hemel (Afrikaans)	rdyleHqBdKU	Die Bybel se Weg na die Hemel \r\n\r\nDie Bybel is rerig duidelik oor Redding. Dit is nie baseer op hoe goed jy is nie. Baie \r\n\r\nmense dink dat as hulle baie goed is, dat hulle Hemel toe gaan gaan omdat \r\n\r\nhulle baie goed was maar die Bybel sê, “Want almal wat gesondig het kom kort van die \r\n\r\nglorie van God.” (Romeine 3:23) Die Bybel sê, “Dit is geskryf daar is geen regverdiges nie, \r\n\r\nnee, nie een nie.” (Romeine 3:10) Ek is nie regverdig nie. Jy is nie regverdig nie, en as dit ons \r\n\r\ngoedheid is wat ons in die Hemel kry, gaan nie een van ons nie. \r\n\r\n. Erken dat jy 'n sondaar is. \r\n\r\nDie Bybel sê selfs in Openbaring 21:8, “Maar die bang en die ongelowige, die afskuwelike \r\n\r\nen moordenaars en towenaars en hoereerders en afgod aanbidders, en alle leuenaars sal hulle \r\n\r\ndeel hê in die meer wat brand met vuur en swawel, wat die tweede dood is.” Ek \r\n\r\nhet voorheen gelieg. Almal het voorheen gelieg, so ons het almal gesondig, en ons het dinge gedoen \r\n\r\nerger as lieg. Kom ons wees eerlik: ons almal verdien hel. \r\n\r\n. Besef die straf vir sonde. \r\n\r\nMaar die Bybel sê, “Maar God kommendeer sy liefde na ons, sodat terwyl ons nog \r\n\r\nsondaars was, Christus vir ons gesterf het.” (Romeine 5:8) Jesus Christus, omdat hy ons liefhet, het gekom \r\n\r\nna die aarde. Die Bybel sê hy was 'n manifestering van God in die vlees. God basies het 'n mens vorm \r\n\r\naangeneem. Hy het 'n sondelose lewe gelei. Hy het geen sonde gepleeg nie, en natuurlik, het hulle hom geslaan, \r\n\r\nop hom gespoeg, en hom vasgenael aan die kruis. Die Bybel sê dat terwyl hy aan daardie kruis was \r\n\r\nhy “homself ons sondes gedra het in sy liggaam aan die boom.” (1 Petrus 2:24) So elke sonde \r\n\r\nwat jy nog ooit gedoen het, en elke sonde wat ek al ooit gedoen het - dit was asof Jesus dit gedoen het. Hy \r\n\r\nwas gestraf vir ons sondes. Toe het hulle sy liggaam geneem toe hy gesterf het, en begrawe \r\n\r\ndit in die graf, en sy siel het afgegaan Hel toe vir drie dae en drie nagte (Handelinge \r\n\r\n:). Drie dae later het hy weer opgestaan uit die dode. Hy het aan die disipels gewys \r\n\r\ndie gate in sy hande. Die Bybel is rerig duidelik dat Jesus vir almal gesterf het. Dit sê \r\n\r\ndat hy gesterf het “nie net vir ons sondes nie, maar ook vir die sondes van die hele wêreld” \r\n\r\n(1 Johannes 2:2). Maar daar is iets wat ons moet doen om gered te word. Die Bybel het daardie vraag \r\n\r\nin Handelinge 16, “Wat moet ek doen om gered te word? En hulle sê, “Glo in die Here Jesus \r\n\r\nChristus, en jy sal gered word, asook jou huis.” Dit is al. Hy het NIE gesê, “Sluit aan by 'n kerk, \r\n\r\nen jy gaan gered word. Word gedoop, en jy gaan gered word. Lewe 'n goeie lewe, en jy gaan \r\n\r\ngered word. Belei al jou sondes, en jy gaan gered word, NEE. Hy het gesê “glo.” \r\n\r\n. Glo dat Jesus gesterf het, begrawe was, en opgestaan het vir jou. \r\n\r\nSelfs die bekendste vers in die hele Bybel, waarvan die verwysing geskryf is op die bodem van \r\n\r\ndie koppie by “In and Out Burger.” Dit is baie bekend. Almal het al gehoor daarvan: Johannes \r\n\r\n3:16. “Want so lief het God die wêreld gehad dat hy sy eniggebore seun gegee het sodat almal \r\n\r\nwat in hom glo nie sal vergaan nie maar die ewige lewe sal erf.” En ewige beteken \r\n\r\newige. Dit beteken verewig, en Jesus het gesê, “Ek gee aan hulle die ewige lewe, en hulle \r\n\r\nsal nooit vergaan, en ook sal geen mens hul uit my hand uit pluk.” (Johannes 10:28) \r\n\r\nDie Bybel sê in Johannes 6:47, “Waarlik, waarlik, ek sê aan julle, hy wat glo in my het \r\n\r\ndie ewige lewe.” So as jy glo in Jesus Christus, sê die Bybel jy het ewige \r\n\r\nlewe. Jy gaan verewig lewe. Jy kan nie jou redding verloor nie. Dit is verewig, dit is \r\n\r\nnimmer eindigend. As jy eers gered is, as jy eers in hom glo, is jy verewig gered, en \r\n\r\nmaak nie saak wat, jy kan nooit jou redding verloor nie. \r\n\r\nSelfs as jy uitgaan en gaan pleeg 'n aaklige sonde, God gaan my straf daarvoor op hierdie aarde. \r\n\r\nAs ek uitgaan en iemand vandag gaan doodmaak, God gaan seker maak dat ek gestraf word, ek \r\n\r\ngaan tronk toe, of veel erger, of die dood straf. Hoe ookal die wêreld my straf, en \r\n\r\nGod gaan seker maak dat ek selfs meer gestraf word, maar ek gaan nie Hel toe nie. Daar is \r\n\r\nniks wat ek kan doen om Hel toe te gaan want ek is gered, en as ek hel toe gaan, dan het God gejok. \r\n\r\nWant hy het belowe dat wie ookal glo die ewige lewe sal hê, en hy het gesê, “Wie ookal \r\n\r\nlewe en glo in my sal nooit sterf.” Dit is hoekom daar baie voorbeelde is van \r\n\r\nmense in die Bybel wat maar baie slegte dinge gedoen het, tog het hulle nogsteeds Hemel toe gegaan. Hoe? Omdat \r\n\r\nhulle so goed was? NEE, dit is omdat hulle glo in die Here Jesus Christus. Hulle sondes \r\n\r\nis vergewe. Ander mense het dalk 'n beter lewe gelei in die wêreld se oë, of miskien \r\n\r\nhet hulle rerig 'n beter lewe gelei, as hulle nie glo in Christus, dan gaan hulle \r\n\r\nHel toe om gestraf te word vir hulle sondes. \r\n\r\n. Vertrou Christus alleen as jou redder. \r\n\r\nLaat ek net afsluit op hierdie gedagte: een ding wat ek verseker en op wil bring \r\n\r\nvandag is dat daar 'n vraag was wat gevra was aan Jesus deur een van sy disipels, en \r\n\r\ndaardie vraag was: is daar min wat gered is? Dit is 'n goeie vraag, reg? \r\n\r\nIs meeste mense gered? Of is dit min wat gered is? Wie hier dink dat meeste mense \r\n\r\nHemel toe gaan - dat meeste mense in hierdie wêreld Hemel toe gaan? Raai wat die \r\n\r\nantwoord was: hy het gesê, in Mattheus , “Gaan jy in by die reguit hek want wyd is die \r\n\r\nhek en breed is die weg wat lei na vernietiging, en daar is menigte wat daar \r\n\r\ningaan want reguit is die hek, en nou is die weg wat lei na lewe, en min \r\n\r\ngaan daar wees wat dit vind.” (Mattheus :-) Dan het hy verder dit gesê: “Nie almal \r\n\r\nwat aan my sê, Here, Here, sal die koninkryk van die hemel binnegaan, maar hy wat die \r\n\r\nwil van my vader doen wat in die Hemel is. Menigte gaan aan my op daardie dag sê, Here, Here, het \r\n\r\nons nie geprofiseer in u naam, en in u naam het ons duiwels uitgedryf, en in u naam \r\n\r\nhet ons baie wonderlike dade gedoen? En dan sal ek verkondig aan hulle, ek het jou nooit geken, verlaat \r\n\r\njulle uit my aangesig.” (Mattheus :-) \r\n\r\nEerstens, die meerderheid van hierdie wêreld maak nie eens of hul in Jesus glo. Dankie tog \r\n\r\ndie meerderheid van hierdie klaskamer sê hulle glo in Jesus, maar die meerderheid van die wêreld maak \r\n\r\nnie eens of hulle glo in Jesus. Maar God waarsku dat selfs tussen die wat maak of hulle glo \r\n\r\nin Jesus, selfs onder die wat hom Here noem, menigte gaan sê aan hom, “Ons het al hierdie \r\n\r\nwonderlike werke gedoen! Hoekom is ons nie gered nie!” En hy gaan sê, “Verlaat my, ek het julle \r\n\r\nnooit geken nie.” Dit is omdat redding nie deur my toedoen is nie, en as jy jou eie toedoen vertrou \r\n\r\nom jou te red, as jy dink jy gaan Hemel toe omdat jy gedoop is, \r\n\r\nas jy dink, “Wel, ek dink jy moet 'n goeie lewe lei, ek dink jy moet die \r\n\r\ngebooie gehoorsaam om gered te word, ek dink jy moet kerk toe gaan, ek dink jy moet \r\n\r\nwegdraai van jou sondes…” As jy vertrou in jou eie toedoen, gaan Jesus eendag vir \r\n\r\njou sê, “Verlaat my, ek het jou nooit geken nie.” \r\n\r\nJy moet al jou geloof hê in dit wat hy gedoen het. Jy moet jou geloof plaas in dit wat Jesus gedoen \r\n\r\nhet aan die kruis toe hy vir jou gesterf het, begrawe was, en weer opgestaan het. Dit is jou kaartjie na \r\n\r\ndie Hemel. As jy in ander dinge glo, en jy sê, “Wel, ek gaan Hemel toe \r\n\r\nwant ek is so 'n goeie Christen, en ek doen al hierdie wonderlike dinge.” Gaan hy aan \r\n\r\njou sê, “Verlaat my.” Neem kennis van wat hy sê, “Verlaat my, ek het jou NOOIT geken nie.” \r\n\r\nHy het nie gesê, “Ek het jou geken nie.” As hy jou eers ken… onthou dat ek genoem het \r\n\r\nvoorheen: dit is nimmer eindigend dit is verewig. As hy jou eers ken, dan is jy gered verewig. \r\n\r\nHy gaan sê, “Verlaat my, ek het jou nooit geken nie,” want as jy Hel toe gaan, is \r\n\r\ndit omdat hy jou nooit geken het nie. Want as hy jou eers ken, dan ken hy jou. Net soos my kinders \r\n\r\naltyd my kinders gaan wees. Wanneer jy weer gebore word, wanneer jy sy kind is, dan is \r\n\r\njy altyd sy kind. Jy mag dalk die swart skaap van die familie wees. Jy mag dalk iemand wees wat \r\n\r\nbaie deur God gedisiplineer word op hierdie aarde. Jy kan jou lewe hier onder opneuk, maar \r\n\r\njy kan nie redding opneuk nie. As jy eers gered is, dan is dit gedane sake. Dit is die hoof \r\n\r\nding wat ek wil oordra aan julle oor die eind tyd, en ons het rerig net 'n paar minute \r\n\r\nvir vrae omtrent beide redding of die eind tyd. \r\n\r\nLiewe Jesus, ek weet dat ek 'n sondaar is. Ek weet ek verdien om Hel toe te gaan. \r\n\r\nMaar ek glo dat u gesterf het aan die kruis vir my en weer opgestaan het. Red my asseblief op hierdie oomblik \r\n\r\nen gee aan my die ewige lewe. Ek vertrou slegs op u, Jesus. Amen.	2015-04-22	2017-04-24 19:36:44.365362	2017-04-24 19:36:44.365362	3	die-bybel-se-weg-na-die-hemel-afrikaans
16	Gedagtes vir die Stuur van Sendelinge		###### Ons Moet Kieskeurig Wees Oor Die Sendelinge Wat Ons Ondersteun\r\n\r\nAs jy al ‘n geruime tyd in die kerk is, dan het jy sekerlik al gehoor hoe die pastore kla oor die lui sendelinge wat nie eens probeer om siele te wen terwyl hulle hier in die Verenigde State is nie. As ‘n sendeling nie hier wil siele wen nie sal hy dit tien teen een nêrens anders doen nie. Die eerste kwalifikasie vir ‘n sendeling is om in ‘n plaaslike kerk opgelei te word. Die tweede een is dat hy sy vermoë om tydens sy plaaslike diens te preek en die evangelie te versprei tydens moet kan demonstreer. Ons wil graag sendelinge ondersteun wat ons kan vertrou om in die veld produktief te wees, maar kerke moet ook definitief selektief wees in die sendings-areas.\r\n\r\n“En verder word van die bedienaars vereis dat hulle getrou bevind moet word.” 1 Korintiërs 4:2\r\n\r\n“En wat jy van my gehoor het onder baie getuies, vertrou dit toe aan getroue manne wat bekwaam sal wees om ook ander te leer.” 2 Timoteus 2:2\r\n\r\n###### Ons Moet Sendelinge Stuur Na Ontvanklike Areas\r\n\r\nOns kerk verkies om meer te konsentreer op ontvanklike areas wat ek glo bybels is:\r\n\r\n“En die woord van die Here is deur die hele land verbrei. Maar die Jode het die godsdienstige en aansienlike vroue en die vernaamste mense van die stad opgehits en teen Paulus en Bárnabas ’n vervolging in die lewe geroep en hulle buite hul gebied verdryf. Toe het hulle die stof van hul voete teen hulle afgeskud en na Ikónium gegaan.” Handelinge 13:49-51\r\n\r\n“En almal wat julle nie ontvang nie — as julle van daardie stad weggaan, skud selfs die stof van julle voete af, tot ’n getuienis teen hulle.” Lukas 9:5\r\n\r\nDie Bybel leer ons dat as mense nie geïnteresseerd is nie, jy moet aan beweeg. In stede van na ‘n land gaan waar jou kerk in die skadu’s moet bly, sal jy meer mense red deur na ‘n ontvanklike area te gaan waar jy wettiglik kan preek. In sekere lande beoefen sendelinge die evangelie leefstyl vir maande voor hulle voel dit is veilig om die evangelie te noem. Ek verstaan die waarde van een siel, maar wat van die waarde van baie siele?\r\n\r\n###### Bereik Buitelandse Immigrante\r\n\r\n‘n Ander manier om mense in areas sonder baie vryheid te bereik is deur die evangelie aan immigrante uit daardie areas te gee. Ek kan jou neem om siele te wen in areas van Phoenix, Arizona, waar jy sal voel of jy in Afrika, die Midde Ooste, of Sjina is. Deur immigrante met die evangelie te bereik, kan jy hulle familielede indirek oorsee bereik.\r\n\r\n###### Stuur die Beste van die Beste\r\n\r\n‘n Sendeling moet gewillig wees om teen die valse gelowe in die area te praat en hard teen sonde te preek. ‘n Vreemde land is nie die plek om mense na te stuur wat nie die vrymoedigheid of aanleg het om mense te kan leer nie. Net soos ‘n pastoor, ‘n sendeling of ‘n evangelis soos die Bybel dit noem, ‘n sterk man van God moet wees.\r\n\r\n###### Ons Nuwe Sending na Botswana, Africa\r\n\r\n[Klik hier](http://www.faithfulwordbaptist.org/botswana.html) om ons fantastiese nuwe sendeling na Botswana, Broeder Garrett Kirchway, te ondersteun. Botswana is een van die meer ontvanklike areas in Afrika, en Broeder Kirchway is ‘n dinamiese prediker wat die Bybel ken en vir 8 jaar as ‘n siel wenner in ons kerk gedien het. As jy sy voorbeeld wil volg as ‘n sendeling, moet jy die Bybel ken, hard preek en soos ‘n masjien siele kan wen.\r\n\r\n[Hier is ‘n preek om saam met hierdie artikel te gaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67FOt-m-jE)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-24 19:39:48.263639	2017-04-25 16:25:59.48369	3	gedagtes-vir-die-stuur-van-sendelinge
17	Ope brief aan die persoon wat teen Verity Baptist Church betoog		As jy hoop dat ek jou naam gaan noem in hierdie skrif, sodat jy iets kan hê om oor te spog aan jou skandseun vriende, gaan jy teleurgesteld wees. Op hierdie punt, daar is geen behoefte om ons teenwoordigheid op die internet te gebruik om jou enige publisiteit te gee nie. Dit is nie die Christene wat belangstel om mense te belaster en laster nie, maar jy en jou vriende. Jy sal ons nie tekens sien vashou by die homo-vriendelike Metodiste en Vryheid kerke nie. Ons sal jou nie afneem of jou nommer plaat afteken nie. Ons is te besig om ons kinders groottemaak en om die Here te bedien, en ons soek nie vir moeilikheid nie.\r\n\r\nOns het nie tyd te mors om bekommerd te wees oor uitgebrande skewe aas met niks beter om te doen as om te probeer om 'n bende van verwerp werf om mense te laster wat in en uit die kerk loop. Jy is die een wat 'n obsessie het. Ons sal nie jou naam publiseer nie, maar jy, 'n vyand van die Here se werk, is op 'n groot deel van ons gebed lyste-en nie in 'n goeie manier nie.\r\n\r\nDis lagwekkend om te sien hoeveel kommentaar, waar mense dreig om te kry Pastoor Jimenez afgedank vir prediking op ongewild gedeeltes in die Bybel. Onafhanklike Baptiste is nie deel van 'n Baptiste denominasie soos die Southern Baptist Convention of die Amerikaanse Baptiste. Ons is uitgestuur deur ander onafhanklike Baptiste kerke, en elke kerk is outonome. Die pastoor is die leier van 'n Bybelse, Nuwe Testament Baptiste kerk.\r\n\r\nDit gesê, 'n Baptiste kerk is nie 'n kult nie. Mense in hierdie kerk het gemoedere van hul eie, so een van die dae, kan jy dalk mors met die verkeerde persoon. Om mense te tesiter wat jy nie ken nie, kan gevaarlik wees. Verity se lede is waarskynlik nie ingenome met 'n klomp vuil faggotte en bul-gange wat hulle en hul kinders week na week agtervolg en fotografeer. Meer gevaarlik as om sommige veteraan met PTSV af te teister of om hom te verwar met iemand in 'n vooraanstaande familie,dit nooi die toorn van God self.\r\n\r\n"Vreeslik is dit om te val in die hande van die lewende God." Hebreërs 10:31\r\n\r\nJy sê in jou kommentaar dat jy nie 'n homoseksuele is nie. As dit die geval is, miskien het jy nog nie omgedraai oor 'n slegte gesindheid nie, en kan jy steeds gered word. Na alles, Saul, wat later Paulus was,het die kerk vervolg voor sy bekering. As dit die geval is,bid ek dat jy sal gered word voordat dit vir ewigheid te laat is.\r\n\r\n"En hulle het hom buitekant die stad uitgewerp en hom gestenig; en die getuies het hulle klere neergelê by die voete van ’n jongman met die naam van Saulus. En hulle het Stéfanus gestenig terwyl hy die Here aanroep en sê: Here Jesus, ontvang my gees! En hy het op sy knieë neergeval en met ’n groot stem uitgeroep: Here, reken hulle hierdie sonde nie toe nie! En met dié woorde het hy ontslaap." - Hand 7:58-60\r\n\r\nEk twyfel sterk dat jy die volgende apostel Paulus is, maar as dit steeds moontlik is vir jou om in die Here Jesus Christus te glo, dan moet hierdie sonde nie gelê word om jou lading. Miskien, omdat jy bly luister na Pastoor Jimenez se preke, sal iets in sink.\r\n\r\nOf jy nou 'n verandering van hart oorkom,regsprobleme teëkom of dood neer val,is daar baie Christene wat bid dat jy sal gestop word. Ek wil nie in jou skoene wees op die oomblik nie.\r\n\r\nDie uwe,  \r\nFundamentele Baptiste regoor Amerika\r\n\r\n[Hier is 'n preek oor vervloekende gebed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcYpj6i7aak)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-25 17:23:47.070283	2017-04-25 17:23:47.070283	3	ope-brief-aan-die-persoon-wat-teen-verity-baptist-church-betoog
18	 Bybelse Redes Om Suiker In Jou Dieet In Te Sluit		Indien jy drie dieetkundiges sou vra wat die ideale dieet is, sal jy sonder twyfel drie verskillende antwoorde kry. Daar is net soveel wat ons nie verstaan nie ten opsigte van die menslike liggaam. Die feit dat verskillende kulture dikwels drastiese verskillende diëte het is net ‘n bewys van die aanpasbaarheid van die liggaam. Voeding is ‘n baie ingewikkelde onderwerp, en daar is heelwaarskynlik nog baie belangrike voedingstowwe wat steeds ontdek moet word.\r\n\r\nSoos met elke aspek van die lewe, het die Bybel al die antwoorde, so die beste voedings praktyk is om te probeer om ‘n gebalanseerde dieet te eet, wat die voedsel insluit wat spesifiek in die Bybel genoem word.\r\n\r\nDie Bybel Verskoon Soetgoed “Verder het hy vir hulle gesê: Gaan, eet lekker spys en drink soet dranke en stuur porsies aan hulle vir wie niks berei is nie; want hierdie dag is heilig aan onse HERE. Wees dan nie bedroef nie, want die blydskap in die HERE — dit is julle beskutting.” Nehemía 8:111\r\n\r\n###### Suiker Is In Orde In Matigheid\r\n\r\nOormatige inname van verwerkde suiker is gekoppel aan lae energie vlakke so wel as vetsug, maar die Bybel onderrig dat heuning, ‘n natuurlike suiker, goed is in matigheid.\r\n\r\n“Het jy heuning gevind, eet tot jy genoeg het, sodat jy daar nie sat van word en dit uitspuug nie.” Spreuke 25:16\r\n\r\nDis egter nie net heuning wat in die Bybel genoem word nie. Baie mense besef nie dat suikerriet (kalmoes) ook in die Bybel genoem word nie.\r\n\r\n“Waarom sou daar tog vir My wierook uit Skeba kom en die kosbare kalmoes uit ’n ver land? Julle brandoffers is nie welgevallig nie, en julle slagoffers is My nie aangenaam nie.” Jeremia 6:20\r\n\r\n“Jy het vir My geen kalmoes2 met geld gekoop en met die vet van jou slagoffers My nie verkwik nie; maar jy het My oorlas aangedoen met jou sondes, jy het My vermoei met jou ongeregtighede.” Jesaja 43:24\r\n\r\n###### Kinders Leer Deur Heuning Te Eet\r\n\r\n“Eet heuning, my seun, want dit is goed, en heuningstroop is soet teen jou verhemelte. Erken dat die wysheid só is vir jou siel; as jy dit vind, dan is daar ’n toekoms, en jou hoop sal nie verydel word nie.” Spreuke 24: 13-14\r\n\r\n“Dikmelk en heuning sal hy eet as hy weet om te verwerp wat kwaad is en om te kies wat goed is.” Jesaja 7:15\r\n\r\nKinders het van nature ‘n soet tand, en Jesus Christus was self nie ontneem van soetgoed as ‘n kind of as ‘n volwassene nie. Nie net weet ons dat hy heuning geëet het nie maar ons word selfs ‘n rede gegee vir dit. Ons mag dalk nie ten volle die geestelike voordele van heuning verstaan wat in die boonste verse na verwys word nie, maar ons wil definitief hê ons kinders moet meedeel in die wysheid oor hoe om die goed in die lewe te kies.\r\n\r\nDaar is soveel dinge waarvoor ons moet nee sê in vandag se dae. Moenie jouself en jou kinders ontneem van een van die lewe se mees natuurlike plesiere nie. Voeding tendense verander heeltyd, maar God se Woord verander nooit.\r\n\r\n[Hier is ‘n onlangse preek oor Bybelse Voeding.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5RZ4i6DmlQ)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-25 17:38:39.892923	2017-04-25 17:38:39.892923	3	bybelse-redes-om-suiker-in-jou-dieet-in-te-sluit
19	Gandhi, jou skynheilige!		“Ek sou ŉ Christen wees as dit nie vir die Christene was nie” Gandhi\r\n\r\nEk is siek en sat vir Christene wat die mantra herhaal: haat die sonde, wees lief vir die sondaar. Asof dit in die Bybel gestaan het. Hierdie gesegde is in werklikheid ŉ Mahatma Gandhi aanhaling en Gandhi was nie die held wat jy dink hy was nie. Sit end aan die aanhaling van hierdie skynheilige, false profeet en pervert wie nou in die hel brand!\r\n\r\n###### Pro Oorlog Stukke\r\n\r\n“ŉ Oog vir ŉ oog maak die hele wêreld blind” Gandhi\r\n\r\nGandhi het teen geweld gepreek, maar soos baie politici was hy skynheilig. In werklikheid het hierdie self geproklameerde pasifis ŉ pamflet geskryf gedurende Wêreld Oorlog I genaamd Appèl vir Indienstreding. Later, in Wêreld Oorlog II het hy nie-gewelddadige morele ondersteuning aan Brittanje aangebied. Alhoewel Gandhi nooit eens ŉ vlieg kon seermaak nie, het hy ander aangemoedig om in oorloë te veg, wat die teenoorgesteld was van sy nie-gewelddadige beginsels.\r\n\r\n###### Vrugtariër\r\n\r\n“Dit is ŉ arrogante aanname om te sê dat alle menslike wesens here en meesters is van die laer skeppings” Gandhi Gandhi, soos baie Hindoes, was ŉ vegetariër en het geleer dat dit misdaad was om vleis te eet, waarna hy met minagting as karkaste verwys het. Hy was teen die inneem van dierprodukte en het op ŉ ekstreme vrugtariër dieet gegaan vir vyf jaar, wat veroorsaak het dat hy lei aan pleuris. Toe ŉ dokter vir hom ingelig het dat hy nie slegs van vrugte af kon leef nie, het hy onwillig begin om bokmelk te drink.\r\n\r\n###### Selibaat\r\n\r\nGandhi het geleer dat behalwe vir pogings van voortplanting, was selibaat in ŉ huwelik die superieure staat. Gandhi het 'n eed van selibaat later in sy huwelik geneem en het dus die fisiese verhouding met sy vrou gediskonteer. In plaas daarvan was hy gereeld deur naak jong vrouens in sy bed vergesel, wat hy volgehou het net ŉ toets was. Sy skrywe, wat die ongure besonderhede van hierdie ontmoetings bevat het, was vir baie jare na sy dood weggesteek.\r\n\r\nHou op Gandhi, ŉ Hindi/Boeddhis bedrieër, aan te haal en maak die Bybel jou prioriteit.\r\n\r\n"MAAR die Gees sê uitdruklik dat in die laaste tye sommige van die geloof afvallig sal word en verleidende geeste en leringe van duiwels sal aanhang deur die geveinsdheid van leuenaars wat gebrandmerk is in hulle eie gewete, wat verbied om te trou en gebied dat die mense hulle moet onthou van voedsel wat God geskape het om met danksegging gebruik te word deur die gelowiges en die wat die waarheid ken. Want alles wat deur God geskape is, is goed, en niks is verwerplik as dit met danksegging ontvang word nie;” 1 Timoteus 4:1-4\r\n\r\n“En God het gesê: Laat Ons mense maak na ons beeld, na ons gelykenis, en laat hulle heers oor die visse van die see en die voëls van die hemel en die vee en oor die hele aarde en oor al die diere wat op die aarde kruip.” Genesis 1:26\r\n\r\n“Oog vir oog, tand vir tand, hand vir hand, voet vir voet,” Eksodus 21:24\r\n\r\n“’n tyd om lief te hê en ’n tyd om te haat, ’n tyd vir oorlog en ’n tyd vir vrede.” Prediker 3:8\r\n\r\n[Hier is 'n preek oor Skynheiligheid wat praat oor Gandhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwOFdhBggkU)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-25 17:46:46.245421	2017-04-25 17:46:46.245421	3	gandhi-jou-skynheilige
20	Wanneer Kerke Duur Raak		[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uRvs7EAlfUY/V4VqlEzp_bI/AAAAAAAADTQ/6JIYvib0Vj08pZeiBNKZfIw_JD_i49fcgCLcB/s400/mountain-dripping-dew.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uRvs7EAlfUY/V4VqlEzp_bI/AAAAAAAADTQ/6JIYvib0Vj08pZeiBNKZfIw_JD_i49fcgCLcB/s1600/mountain-dripping-dew.jpg)\r\n\r\nBy Faithful Word Baptiste Kerk, vra ons vir niks geld nie. Ons gee Bybels, CD’s en DVD’s weg, en alle kerk aktiwiteite is gratis. Die rede waarom ons geen gelde vra vir hierdie dinge, kan gevind word in Johannes Hoofstuk Twee. Nie net is dit verkeerd om God se huis ‘n huis van goedere te maak, maar mens hou nie daarvan om in ‘n kollig geplaas te word om geld te spandeer. Ongelukkig deur sommige kerke by te woon, kan dit duur raak.\r\n\r\n###### Jeugbediening of Jeug Industrie?\r\n\r\nIn een groot onafhanklike fundamentele Baptiste Kerk, het ek gehoor dat tieners in ‘n Sondagskool klas gevra is om Vyf Dollar elk te gee, om te help betaal vir ‘n “personeel geskenk”. Die Jeugleier het aggressief vir die klas gepreek en vir hulle vertel dat hulle heel moontlik hul geld oor naweke by ‘n pretpark spandeer. Baie tieners het nie eers werk nie, en as hulle het, is daar niks fout daarmee dat hul pret wil hê met hul eie geld. Daardie selfde kerk bied jaarliks ‘n groot jeug konferensie aan, wat grootliks dien as ‘n lewende advertensie vir hul Bybel Kollege asook boeke en CD’s wat ingebring word deur hul gas sprekers.\r\n\r\n###### Koop die Kommentaar\r\n\r\nBy ‘n ander kerk in dieselfde sirkel, was vrouens gedruk om ‘n boek te koop oor die standaarde van hul kleredrag, sodat hulle sou weet wat verwag word van hulle om aan te trek. Meeste van die dames in die kerk het die boek gekoop, maar een van die dames met wie ek gesels het, wat na daardie spesifieke kerk gaan, het gevoel aangesien hulle wou gehad het sy moet die boek lees, moes hulle dit gratis vir haar gegee het.\r\n\r\n###### Multi-Vlak Bemarking\r\n\r\nDit is nie net die leierskap wat vra vir geld nie. In kerke wat goedere verkoop op die agterste tafel, is daar soms mense wat aanneem dat dit aanvaarbaar is om hul eie goedere daar te bemark. Moenie inloop met jou Mary Kay katalogus of wat ook al jy smous, en ons sal jou ook nie vra om iets te koop. Daar is ‘n tyd en ‘n plek om geld te maak, en dit is nie by die kerk nie.\r\n\r\n###### Sondag Oggend Gaskoeldrank\r\n\r\nGaskoeldrank masjiene by kerke irriteer mens ook, want dit kan veroorsaak dat hul kinders vra vir geld tydens elke kerk diens, om nie eers te praat van die voor hand liggende gesondheids bekommernisse.\r\n\r\nAs jy ‘n kerk bywoon wat ‘n boekwinkel of ‘n gaskoeldrank masjien het, moet jy jouself weerhou om enige iets daar te koop. Jesus het ons nie alleenlik geleer om nie God se huis as ‘n huis van goedere te maak, maar ons kan sien deur die storie te lees dat dit Hom ongelooflik kwaad maak:\r\n\r\n“En die pasga van die Jode was naby, en Jesus het opgegaan na Jerusalem. En Hy het in die tempel gevind die wat beeste en skape en duiwe verkoop, en die geldwisselaars wat daar sit. En Hy het ’n sweep van toutjies gemaak en almal uit die tempel uitgedrywe, ook die skape en die beeste, en die kleingeld van die wisselaars het Hy uitgegooi en hulle tafels omgekeer. En vir die duiweverkopers het Hy gesê: Neem daardie dinge hier weg; moenie die huis van my Vader ’n handelshuis maak nie.” – Johannes 2:13-16\r\n\r\n[Hier is ‘n preek genaamd “Huise van Goedere”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQFiZJmEJAg)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-25 17:51:44.548145	2017-04-25 17:51:44.548145	3	wanneer-kerke-duur-raak
21	Drie Maniere hoe om ‘n swak kerk lidmaat te wees		[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NIyMjK_ys_M/V4Vs46CxN9I/AAAAAAAADTk/U6nXXjzDYxMAOd-F_0LaluicOykvTN7IwCLcB/s400/bad_church_member.jpg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NIyMjK_ys_M/V4Vs46CxN9I/AAAAAAAADTk/U6nXXjzDYxMAOd-F_0LaluicOykvTN7IwCLcB/s1600/bad_church_member.jpg)\r\n\r\n###### 1\\. Probeer om die Pastoor te verander.\r\n\r\nEerstens moet mens besef dat geen twee Christene op presies dieselfde manier glo oor elke klein dingetjie nie. Jy moet ‘n kerk vind wat in lyn is met jou siening oor die belangrikste aspekte en die res moet oor gesien word.\r\n\r\nEen persoon byvoorbeeld, het herhaaldeliks met die Pastoor ontmoet en het desperaat probeer dat die Pastoor die hele struktuur van sy kerk moes verander en dit voor die person eenkeer in die kerk was. Hierdie persoon moes eerder aan gepas het of dan aanbeweeg het na ‘n ander kerk toe. Dis heeltemal in orde om nederig vrae te vrae oor jou verskilllende interpretasie van ‘n sekere vers, maar moet jouself nie dood bekommer oor die klein dingetjies nie. Jy mag dalk net die een wees wat verkeerd is. Kry jou agtersewe net in ‘n goeie kerkbank, sit en hou jou smoel. ( Kry jouself net in ‘n goeie kerk, sit rustig en wees stil)\r\n\r\n“ ’n BEJAARDE man moet jy nie hard bestraf nie, maar vermaan hom soos ’n vader, jongeres soos broers,” 1 Timotius 5:1\r\n\r\n###### 2\\. Vermy Broederskap. ( Gemeenskaplikheid)\r\n\r\nAs Jy byvoorbeeld vir ‘n heel paar jaar dieselfde kerk besoek en die gemeenskap vra gereeld of jy ‘n nuweling is, dan hou jy jouself apart en is jy nie oop en vriendelik nie. ‘n Dame met wie dit die geval was het erken dat sy vertsaan hoekom dit met haar gebeur, want sy praat nooit met enige iemand nie en sy het inderdaad nie. Mag dit nooit van jou gesê word nie vriend.\r\n\r\n"A man that hath friends must **shew** **himself** **friendly**: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother." - Proverbs 18:24\r\n\r\n###### 3\\. Veroorsaak Drama.\r\n\r\nMens hoef nie beste vriende met almal in die gemeenskap te wees nie, maar jy kan darem vriendelik groet of glimlag sou jou paaie kruis met iemand vir wie jy nie die liefste is nie. ( …paaie kruis met iemand van wie jy niks hou nie) As jy dalk vir die persoon bid, mag jou hart oor tyd verander. Die enigste person wie mens kan beheer( verander), is jouself. Hierdie is ‘n belangrike beginsel wat betrekking het op enige verhouding, nie slegs tussen gemeentelede van ‘n kerk nie.\r\n\r\n“Bely mekaar julle misdade en bid vir mekaar, sodat julle gesond kan word. Die vurige gebed van ’n regverdige het groot krag.” Jakobus 5:16\r\n\r\nDie beste manier hoe om ‘n goeie kerkganger te wees, is om ‘n kerk te vind waar jy die Pastoor kan respekteer. Wees vriendelik en vermy die versoeking om elke klein probleempie uit te basuin. ( …vermy die versoeking om oor elke klein probleempie te redekawel) Wanneer jy tuiskom, moet nie oor die kerk kla by jou gesin nie. As jy gebraaide Pastoor vir aandete geniet, veroorsaak dit jou kinders en vrou om ‘n swak houding of siening te hê. Moet ook nie die man van God op die internet kritiseer nie. Elke ding wat neergeskryf word kan aan iemand anders gewys word en jou Pastoor mag jou dalk net uit die kerk verban as ‘n opstoker en agterbaks. (kwaadsteker) As jy voel jy kannie langer deel wees van ‘n kerk nie, verwyder jouself grasieus en moet nie die vlam verder aanblaas deur om jou mede kerkgangers te vergiftig nie. (…verwyder jouself grasieus en moet nie die pot roer deur om jou mede kerkgangers op te stook nie)\r\n\r\n[Hier volg ‘n preek oor hoe om vriendelik te wees.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElQfu94Jf7k)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-25 18:00:16.638992	2017-04-25 18:00:16.638992	3	drie-maniere-hoe-om-n-swak-kerk-lidmaat-te-wees
22	Ergeet die dinge wat agtergelaat was.		[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qKAPpkWpnOY/V4Vwm9hWflI/AAAAAAAADUI/HNz00RPqmRcynNc_huuhrK52UmI3hjoYQCLcB/s400/rear-view-mirror.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qKAPpkWpnOY/V4Vwm9hWflI/AAAAAAAADUI/HNz00RPqmRcynNc_huuhrK52UmI3hjoYQCLcB/s1600/rear-view-mirror.jpg)\r\n\r\nDit gebeur gereeld dat mense sondes pleeg wat ernstige nagevolge dra en onherstelbare skade doen aan hul lewens. As jy een van hulle is, moenie die houding inneem dat jy nou gefaal het en daardeur kan jy nie meer God dien nie. Moenie die straf erger maak deur nog meer sondes te pleeg nie. Almal van ons het al van sekere paaie in ons lewens afgedwaal, maar God kan ons nog op soveel maniere gebruik.\r\n\r\n“Want sewe maal val die regverdige en staan weer op, maar die goddelose struikel in die ongeluk.” - Spreuke 24:16\r\n\r\n###### Kinders van Israel\r\n\r\nToe die kinders van Israel uitvind dat hulle nie in die beloofde land sou ingaan nie, was dit nie die tyd om op Moses op te gee en hom te verlaat nie. Hulle het nogsteeds die verantwoordelikheid gehad om by God se kinders te bly en hulle eie kinders groot te maak. Net omdat ouers foute in hul lewens gemaak het, beteken dit nie dat God hierdie ouers nie kan gebruik om godvresende kinders groot te maak nie. Miskien sal julle kinders grootword en doen wat julle veronderstel was om te doen.\r\n\r\n###### Vrou by die put\r\n\r\nDie vrou by die put het ‘n gemors van haar lewe gemaak, tog was sy gebruik om ander mense oor Christus te vertel. Miskien is jy al menigmale geskei of het dalk iets anders gedoen wat onherstelbare skade gedoen het aan jou lewe. Dit beteken nie dat daar nie ‘n plek vir jou is in jou gemeente nie. Natuurlik het die Bybel spesifieke kriteria vir a pastoor of diaken, so daardie deur is gesluit vir jou. Maar daar is baie ander werksgeleenthede vir die Here, en almal moet sielsherwinning gaan doen.\r\n\r\n###### Dawid\r\n\r\nIn Psalm 51 lees ons hoe Dawid bid om te kan aanhou om vir God te lewe, na sy sonde met Batseba. Toe Dawid aangevat was deur die man van God, het hy homself bekeer. Hy het sy sondes bely en verdere werke vir die Here verrig.\r\n\r\n3 Wees my genadig, o God, na u goedertierenheid; delg my oortredinge uit na die grootheid van u barmhartigheid.  \r\n4 Was my heeltemal van my ongeregtigheid en reinig my van my sonde.  \r\n5Want ék ken my oortredinge, en my sonde is altyddeur voor my.  \r\n6 Teen U alleen het ek gesondig en gedoen wat verkeerd is in u oë, sodat U regverdig kan wees as U spreek, rein as U gerig hou.  \r\n7Kyk, in ongeregtigheid is ek gebore, en in sonde het my moeder my ontvang.  \r\n8Kyk, U het ’n welgevalle aan waarheid in die binneste, en in die verborgene maak U aan my wysheid bekend.  \r\n9 Ontsondig my met hisop, dat ek kan rein wees; was my, dat ek witter kan wees as sneeu.  \r\n10Laat my vreugde en blydskap hoor; laat die gebeente juig wat U verbrysel het.  \r\n11Verberg u aangesig vir my sondes en delg uit al my ongeregtighede.  \r\n12Skep vir my ’n rein hart, o God, en gee opnuut in die binneste van my ’n vaste gees.  \r\n13Verwerp my nie van u aangesig nie en neem u Heilige Gees nie van my weg nie.  \r\n14Gee my weer die vreugde van u heil, en ondersteun my deur ’n gewillige gees.  \r\n15Ek wil die oortreders u weë leer, dat die sondaars hulle tot U kan bekeer.\r\n\r\n###### Simson\r\n\r\nSimson was deur godvresende ouers grootgemaak en het ‘n groot gawe ontvang, maar wat het hy gemaak daarmee? Hy het sy Nazaretiese eed gebreek en vrouens nagejaag tot op ‘n punt waar sy lewe heeltemal verwoes was. Teen die einde van sy lewe het die Filistyne hom ‘n slaaf gemaak en sy oë uitgesteek. Die simboliek agter Simson se hare wat weer gegroei het, was dat God hom nog kon gebruik. Die doel van Simson se lewe was om die kinders van Israel te verlos van die Filistyne, wat hy op die einde tog gedoen het. In die ideale wêreld sou hy nie in die proses doodgegaan het nie, maar daar is nagevolge vir ons sondes. Selfs al het Simson vele kere drooggemaak en op baie maniere ‘n mislukking was, het hy sekerlik tevrede gevoel toe hy sy lewensdoel uitgevoer het.\r\n\r\nHopenlik pleeg ons nie dieselfde sondes soos sommige van hierdie Bybelse karakters nie, maar ons sal almal struikel op een of ander manier. Moet nooit opgee nie. God se genade hernu met elke oggend. Terwyl jy nog op hierdie aarde asemhaal het God vir jou iets om te doen.\r\n\r\n“Broeders, ek reken nie dat ek dit self gegryp het nie. Maar een ding: ek vergeet die dinge wat agter is en strek my uit na wat voor is, en jaag na die doel om die prys te verkry van die hoë roeping van God in Christus Jesus.” Filippense 3:13-14\r\n\r\n[Hier is ‘n preek oor God se plan B vir ons lewens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL3yJtEQmog)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-25 18:06:36.718534	2017-04-25 18:06:36.718534	3	ergeet-die-dinge-wat-agtergelaat-was
23	Pous Francis is Te Liberaal Selfs vir Meeste Katolieke		[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_FWWpAJw3-A/V4VthbleBgI/AAAAAAAADTs/FWFAKA2gL5QrApN3L-KHcVJp6CZB7U4rgCLcB/s400/pope_francis_rainbow.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_FWWpAJw3-A/V4VthbleBgI/AAAAAAAADTs/FWFAKA2gL5QrApN3L-KHcVJp6CZB7U4rgCLcB/s1600/pope_francis_rainbow.jpg)  \r\n"Indien iemand homoseksueel is en hy is opsoek na die Heer en hy het goeie intensies, wie is ek om te oordeel?" was Pous Francis se beroemde stellings rondom homoseksualiteit. Die waarheid is, selfs die meeste Katolieke vind die huidige pous te liberaal.\r\n\r\n###### Pous Francis letterlik Omhels Sodomiete\r\n\r\nDie volgende is 'n uittreksel vanuit die Washington Post Artikel, 8 van Pous Francis se Mees Liberale Stlling waar ons die pous se reaksie gegee word ten opsigte van transseksualiteit:\r\n\r\n"In 'n stil gereëlde vergadering by die Vatikaan, het Francis vir Diego Neria Lejarraga, 48, verwelkom. Gebore 'n vrou, het Lejarraga later 'n prosedure ondergaan om 'n transseksuele man te word. Eens genoem "die duiwel se dogter" deur 'n plaaslike priester in sy tuiste Spanje, het Lejarraga vertroosting gesoek van Francis in 'n vergadering privaat bevestig deur Vatikaan amptenare. Francis het beide Lejarraga en sy verloofde genooi na die Vatikaan vir 'n ontmoeting. Toe Lejarraga die pous gevra het of hy 'n plek in die kerk het, het die pous blykbaar geantwoord met 'n omhelsing." Gaan Diego Gaan! (Hel toe) Want jy sien, volgens Pous Francis, gaan selfs ateïste Hemel toe.\r\n\r\n###### Die Katolieke Kerk Verander Vinnig\r\n\r\nIn 'n ander Washington Post artikel, het Pous Francis versoek vir die insluiting van homoseksueles in die samelewing, deur te sê dat hy geen reg het om te 'oordeel' nie beklemtoon die verskil tussen die vorige pous, Benedict, en die huidige pous, Francis:\r\n\r\n"Selfs al het Benedict 'n beroep gedoen op Katolieke om "groot respek vir [homoseksuele] mense" te toon, het hy die publikasie van 'n kerk dokument oorsien wat homoseksuele inklinasies "afwykings" noem en 'n beroep doen om mans met "diep-gewortelde" homo neigings te verban uit die priesterskap. Hy sê ook dat selfde-seks huwelik 'n verraderlike gevaar tot die algemene welstand hou."\r\n\r\nKatolisisme is 'n heidense geloof wat 'n werkings verlossing verkondig. Alle Katolieke pouse is uit die bose, maar my punt is dat Pous Francis deur so liberaal te wees, 'n teken van die tye is. Die samelewing is besig om vinnig te verander.\r\n\r\n"1MAAR weet dit, dat daar in die laaste dae swaar tye sal kom. 2Want die mense sal liefhebbers van hulleself wees, geldgieriges, grootpraters, trotsaards, lasteraars, ongehoorsaam aan hulle ouers, ondankbaar, onheilig, 3sonder natuurlike liefde, onversoenlik, kwaadsprekers, bandeloos, wreed, sonder liefde vir die goeie, 4verraaiers, roekeloos, verwaand, meer liefhebbers van genot as liefhebbers van God; 5 mense wat ’n gedaante van godsaligheid het, maar die krag daarvan verloën het. Keer jou ook van hierdie mense af. 6Want uit hulle is die wat in die huise insluip en arme vroue gevange neem wat met sondes belaai is en deur allerhande begeerlikhede gedryf word, 7wat altyd leer en nooit tot die kennis van die waarheid kan kom nie. 8En net soos Jannes en Jambres Moses teëgestaan het, so staan ook hierdie mense die waarheid teë, mense verdorwe in die verstand, onbetroubaar ten opsigte van die geloof. 9Maar hulle sal nie verder voortgaan nie, want hulle dwaasheid sal vir almal duidelik wees, soos ook dié van daardie manne geword het. 10Maar jy het my navolger geword in leer, lewenswandel, planne, geloof, lankmoedigheid, liefde, lydsaamheid, 11vervolginge, lyding, soos my te beurt geval het in Antiochíë, in Ikónium, in Listre. Watter vervolginge het ek nie al verdra nie! En die Here het my uit almal verlos. 12En almal wat ook godvrugtig wil lewe in Christus Jesus, sal vervolg word. 13Maar goddelose mense en bedrieërs sal voortgaan van kwaad tot erger, hulle wat verlei en verlei word. 14Maar bly jy in wat jy geleer het en waarvan jy verseker is, omdat jy weet van wie jy dit geleer het, 15en dat jy van kleins af die heilige Skrifte ken wat jou wys kan maak tot saligheid deur die geloof in Christus Jesus. 16 Die hele Skrif is deur God ingegee en is nuttig tot lering, tot weerlegging, tot teregwysing, tot onderwysing in die geregtigheid, 17sodat die mens van God volkome kan wees, vir elke goeie werk volkome toegerus." - II TIMÓTHEÜS3\r\n\r\nDie volgende generasie van Katolieke mag dalk minder geneig wees om op te let as hul pous erger en erger was, maar ten minste is daar nou sekere Katolieke wat opsoek is na 'n meer bybelse alternatief. Mense dink dat harde preke mense wegskrik, maar meer gereeld, het dit die teenoorgestelde effek. Onlangs, het ek gehoor van sommige Katolieke wat 'n Baptiste kerk besoek het omdat hulle gehoor het dat die prediker hard gepreek het teen die Sodomiete.\r\n\r\n[Hierdie is 'n harde preek teen Pous Francis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qX9dn1l4d8)  \r\n[Meer in die Afrikaanse](http://sanderson1611za.blogspot.com/)	2016-07-12	2017-04-25 18:13:27.049728	2017-04-25 18:13:27.049728	3	pous-francis-is-te-liberaal-selfs-vir-meeste-katolieke
