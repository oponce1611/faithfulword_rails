    <h4>Psalms Project</h4>
    <p>
    It is extremely difficult to find any psalms from the King James Bible that have been put to music without altering the text. Those that have been put to music are usually only a few verses long, and not the entire psalm. Pastor Anderson's goal is to put all 150 psalms to music without changing a single word of the KJV text. Check back at this page for new additions to the repertoire as the project moves forward.
