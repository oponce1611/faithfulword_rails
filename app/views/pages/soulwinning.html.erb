  <h1>Small Town Soul-Winning Program</h1>
  <p>
    Our church spends several hours a week out soul-winning in the greater Phoenix area. In fact, we have official soul-winning times that meet every day of the week in order to make it convenient for people to work soul-winning into their schedule. We are in the process of eventually knocking every door in our county. However, many small towns, or "villages" as the Bible calls them, scattered across Arizona and across America have never had a soul-winning Baptist church in their town. How will these people hear the Gospel? Many people live and die in small towns with no Gospel-preaching church. How shall they hear without a preacher?
  </p>
  <p>
    Every 3 months, our church spends a Saturday knocking every single door in a small town in Arizona preaching the gospel to everyone who will listen. So far we have knocked every door in Gila Bend, Miami, Cordes Lakes, Congress, Strawberry, Kearny, Hayden, Winkelman, Mammoth, Dudleyville, Black Canyon City, and Peach Springs, and have had many, many people saved. Eventually our church will reach every small town in Arizona with the Gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, our church holds soul-winning marathons in other states to help get people involved in soul-winning who do not attend a church with an agressive soul-winning program. These events are attended by anywhere from 60-150 people. So far, we have held soul-winning marathons in Detroit, Washington DC, Portland, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Boston, Fort Worth, and San Antonio, and we have marathons plannes for Jacksonville and Minneapolis. The goal is to eventually have a soul-winning marathon in each of the 50 states.
